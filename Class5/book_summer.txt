the great lakes the prairies of Illinoisthe rivers Illinois Mississippi and Ohio and over the Alleghanymountains to New York Since she has been ‘urged by friends to print’the author has added to her

which have passed before my eyessince I last beheld you and the crowd of new ideas acquired therebyhave not obliterated your Shaksperian adieu from my mind were your last words—in consequence of this desire I hereby send youall I deem noteworthy With what delight did I find myself once moreupon the Hudson Although so often seen to me it is still lovely forcustom cannot stale its beauties I pass along this river as through agallery of cabinet pictures The sunny vista and romantic glen ofGains14borough—the frowning cliff and murderous dell of Rosa—the Dutchcottage of Teniers—the Italian villa and graceful trees of classicWeir—cattle as if just sprung from out a Berghman and grouped upon theshore or standing ‘in the cool translucent wave’ their ‘loose train ofamberdropping hair’ not being ‘braided with lilies’ but occupied inflapping the flies away—all these and many more are placed side byside before me as I float along You have never seen this famed stream and I will therefore describe itto you minutely Mine will not be ‘notes by the way’ nor ‘crayoning’nor ‘pencil sketches’ but perfect Daguerrotype likenesses of all I see With a bold rush our steamboat was free of the wharf and out into thestream Ascend now to the upper deck with me and you will obtain a fineview of the city of New York and its noble bay Upon one side lies thecity with its mass of houses churches and vessels beyond is LongIsland Observe what a pretty back ground is Staten Island its numerouswhite buildings show well against the green elevated ridge behind themthen turn your eye to the opposite side and you will behold New Jerseywith its pretty city and villages and churches and in the center ofall this is the glassy water covered with steamboats brigs ships ofwar and vessels of all sizes and dotted with pretty fortress isletsHoboken with its neat church and romantic colonade are passed and therugged cliffs of Weehawken rise upon our left as we ascend the riverThese cliffs are the commencement of the Palisade rocks which soonretreat into the interior to arise again above Bul15l’s Ferry worthy ofa better name next appears with Fort Lee pretty rural retreatswhose white houses churches and fences are pencilled as with whitechalk upon the river’s green and sloping bank From the east side turret and spire have passed away and villages andcountry seats adorn the shores until we arrive at Spuyten Duyvel creekrendered famous by the redoubtable Van Corlear who swore he would passit in spigt den Duyvel and also as being the boundary line of ManhattanIsland To a hasty observer the shores beyond this are as lonely andwild as if we were hundreds of miles from any city but if you will fixyour eyes steadily upon the woodlands which line the river banks youwill catch glimpses between the trees of Grecian portico Yankeepiazza or Dutch gable telling of many a summer haunt of the city’s‘tired denizen’ Upon the west side the Palisade commences a perpendicular wall or tospeak more scientifically ‘a columnar escarpement’ from three to eighthundred feet high and two miles broad thus continuing for twenty milesalong the New Jersey side of the river As you dabble in geology I mustnot forget to tell you these rocks are of the trap formation passinginto green stone Under it are layers of slate sandstone and greylimestone much of which is used in the city and its neighborhoodSloops were lying at the foot of the rocks as we passed taking intheir load of sandstone flagging or roofing slate for the use of thecitizens These sloops which carry masts sixty or seventy feet highshow the height of these cliffs as when seen anchored below them theyappear like skiffs A few stonecutters have erected16 cottages upon therocks which might be taken for children’s houses Shrubbery is seen insome spots while a green fringe of trees is waving from the summitThese rocks have stood the brunt of that mighty torrent which wise mentell us once rushed over the country from the northwest as if somelake had burst its barrier—for bowlders washed from the Palisades areseen in various parts of Manhattan Island and Long Island To thealluvium brought down by this flood we are indebted for ManhattanIsland and Staten Island What a pity ‘wise saws’ are out of fashion orI could lengthen my epistle by telling what ‘modern instances’ theseislands are of the ‘good’ brought down by ‘ill winds’ As we are both now tired of these Palisades it is very pretty of themto retire as they do into the country making a fine back ground to therich land lying upon the river’s bank adorned with several picturesquetownlets These are Nyack reclining upon a verdant slope Haverstrawnestled under a high green promontory and Tappan which ought to havebeen first mentioned This is however but the ‘landing’ of the town ofthat name lying a few miles in the interior and whose ‘heavens’ oughtto be ‘hung with black’ for the sake of the talented and unfortunateAndre whose silver cord was here untimely loosed The river swells out into a broad lake called Tappan sea which oughtto be spelled Tappann Zee The west side I have described except thatfrom these towns the ground rises into an elevated green ridge ofHaverstraw and then descends gracefully to the water ending in a lowlevel spot covered with a17 rich velvet sward dotted with groups ofoaks and evergreens among which a silver rivulet winds its happy wayThis is very prettily called Grassy Point Upon our right hand we have smooth lawnlike slopes over which thebuildings of Yonkers Tarrytown and Dobbs’ Ferry harmonious soundsare straggling or reposing in graceful groups upon every gentle swellSing Sing with its long range of prisons is before us so called Isuppose that the inhabitants of those abodes may have somethingcheerful about them It is a lovely spot commanding a beautiful view ofthe river scenery—so lovely that I am almost tempted to be wickedthat I may be ordered to reside there and sit like a Naiad sing singingupon a That is all very well you will say when the rock is already cut outfor you to sit upon but where one is obliged to hew out one’s own rockas do these woful singsingers it would be as well to abandon the placeto the heroes who there do congregate They quarry a white granularlimestone which is used as building material The antique Dutch churchlooks very well seated upon an eminence and Wolfert’s Roost with itsDutch points and gables the residence of the celebrated Irving isanother interesting object upon this shore Look behind you quickly if you would take a last farewell of StatenIsland whose dark outline has until now filled up the back groundalthough we are thirty miles from it As we turn towards the narrowoutlet between Stoney and Verplanck’s Points the Palisades are sweepingaround to the east and rapidly shoving18 in their side scene between usand the Island Now it is gone and the Narrows are fast being coveredthrough which you might if your eyes could see so far descry the greenocean and its gallant barks The river now seems a lake behind us uponwhose bright bosom a fleet of vessels like a flock of birds areskimming and ducking or reposing upon the water Two Points defendthe entrance to the Highlands Stony Point on the west a bold rockypromontory formed of fine horneblend granite rock and surmounted by alighthouse Verplanck’s on the east presents a small villagecontaining a pretty fanciful hotel and some lordly dwellings upon theelevated ground above These are now behind us and we find ourselves inthe Grand Pass of the Highlands Beautiful creations they are—highgreen cones sweeping gradually down to the water’s edge where theysometimes appear a verdant precipice nearly two thousand feet high orprojecting their spurs into the river and crossing each other so thatthe Hudson must wind hither and thither to follow the tortuous pathbetween them Various lights give new beauties to these hills It ispleasant when the sun shines broad and bright upon them to penetratewith your eye their green recesses or endeavor to distinguish whetherthose bushes on the summit are indeed trees or no and again when acloud passes running rapidly over the surface the effect is verybeautiful As we were near the centre of the Pass the sun was obscuredand a heavy shower clothed every thing with gloom—Through the sombrelight they seemed like giant mastadon or mammoth of olden timescouching down upon each side musing upon the changes which have19 takenplace upon this diluvial earth The rain has ceased and the mist hasall retired into the mountain caves save on one spot near the summitwhere it lowering stands like one of Ossian’s ghosts whose wont it ishe tells us to ‘fly on clouds and ride on winds’ Or it may be thewandering spirit of some red warrior who has perished on these shoresand now haunts the scene of his former triumphs Upon a promontory jutting out from the river are situated the MilitarySchools of West Point It is a summer’s day well spent to ramble overthat pretty spot If you care not for the Schools nor to see theorderly young cadets you may admire the monument dedicated toKosciusco or walk in his garden as they call the spot where he used to‘sit on rocks’ and muse upon the sweets of Liberty—or you may climb upto that ruined fortress crowning the summit of the mountain whichoverhangs the Point From thence you have a fine view of all the ruggedcultivated wild adorned and varied country for miles around—and ofthat broad silver stream bearing upon its waters many a graceful vesselThe dusky peaks and dells and undulations of the several mountainsaround are here distinctly seen The Dunderberg where is the thunder’s home raises its frowning head atthe right followed by Bare Mountain Sugar Loaf Bull’s Hill Crow’sNest Butter Hill Breakneck Hill and many others bearing designationsequally euphonius Among these hills beside West Point are many spotsfamous in the history of our country Do not be afraid I am not goingto begin ‘In the year 17—’ nor tell of the iron chain which boundAnthony by the nose to the Fort20 opposite nor arouse your indignationby pointing to the chimneys of Arnold’s house nor make you sad byspeaking again of Andre nor arouse your patriotism by relating thedeeds here done in times of old Let the past be bygones and turn tothe present whose sun is shining down upon the pretty village of ColdSpring opposite to us and upon that romantic white chapel dedicated to‘Our Lady of Cold Spring’ which is so tastefully perched upon a rockwashed by the Hudson’s waters At West Point is a depot of fossilenfusoria and sulphur has also been found Shooting out of the HighlandPass we find ourselves in a broad expanse of water presenting some ofthe prettiest views to be seen upon the river Seated upon theelevations of the left bank are many towns Newburgh being the mostconspicuous as it is the largest and it is built upon a high cliff ofargillaceous slate thus displaying its numerous houses and churches toadvantage The opposite shore presents a beautiful green mountain wallthe highest peak of which is 1689 feet above the river At its footreposes the smiling town of Fishkill I must not linger thus by the way Remember I have four thousand milesto travel and the summer is passing Imagine then to yourself a broadand beautiful river skirted with cultivated country with often amountainous back ground and rich with ‘summer’s green emblazonedfield’—and wafting upon its waters rivercraft of all forms from thelazy whaler returning after a four year’s cruise to the little pleasureyacht There are many towns on this river one of which Poughkeepsieis rendered famous as being the place where Washington Hamilton Jayand Chancellor21 Livingston met to compose the Constitution of theUnited States The city of Hudson is agreeably situated upon the summitof a slaty cliff commanding a view of the Catskill mountains and thetown of Athens on the opposite bank of the river Imagine scatteredlike gems upon the borders of the stream pretty villas of GrecianGothic and nondescript styles the homes of the Livingstons DewittsEllisons Verplancks Van Renselears Schuylers and other gentlemen oftaste and wealth I saw nothing of those Dutch elves and fays which thegenius of Irving has conjured up among the dells and rocks of theHudson—those creatures are unfortunately out of fashion and one mightas well look for them as for high heeled shoes Perhaps they will comein with the ancient modes If I thought so I would immediately orderhoop train cushion buckle high heel and all the odious costumewhich rendered my ancestresses so hideous Alas I fear the ‘mincingdryades’ with high crowned hats are all departed—and no more— Albany appears at great advantage seated upon a side hill presenting amass of imposing buildings surmounted by many a tall steeple andcrowned by the Capitol and City Hall from whose gilded dome the eveningsunbeams are brightly streaming I have said nothing about my gallant bark nor my company—the first alarge and rapid steamboat arranged with satin cushioned and canopiedsaloons—the latter a mixture of all countries and sexes But we are at the wharf and I must put up my papers Adieu22 June 15th 1840 My dear E—We shall of course remain in Albany during the Sabbath forthe pleasure of worshipping that kind Friend who has showered upon usthe blessings we are now enjoying In the morning we walked to thechurch of a Baptist clergyman Mr W——h who has been long celebratedas a very interesting preacher This church is a handsome marblestructure surmounted by a dome and adorned by a colonade of pillars infront The lecture room is below and we ascended to the chapel a neatapartment with a good pulpit and commodious seats Mr W sprang from anobscure station being a mechanic and therefore could only obtain acommon education What he is he has made himself or rather was made bythe Holy Spirit for we all know how religion refines and elevates theintellect of man as well as his affections After his conversion herapidly improved and now one is astonished at the beauty and purity ofhis language He is not an animated preacher nor does his forte liein arousing a sinner but he shows forth the23 truth and beauty ofreligion and expounds the Gospel doctrines with a power and grace andclearness which fascinate the hearer This church is always crowded bythe elite of Albanian society of all sects and by the strangers whoare in the city In the afternoon we attended service in an old Dutch church one of theoldest in the city It is built of brick and boasts two spires whichgive it a singular appearance The interior is richly fitted up withgilded chandeliers and many comforts and elegant conveniences Here wefound ourselves surrounded by the old Dutch families whose fathersemigrated from Holland and settled themselves here among them were thefamily of the Patroon I looked around with pleasure upon the soberbenevolent faces of the congregation for I have always felt a verykindly sentiment toward our Dutch brethren The peaceful even tenor oftheir lives their contented spirit their industry and integrityentitle them to our most ‘golden opinions’ The Rev Mr Y—— whoofficiates here is an able solid preacher well versed in thefundamental truths of christianity I am happy to say the people of this city are a very moral andreligious people This applies also to the ‘first society’—which is asingularity in city history Beneath their influence theatresdissipation and extravagance cannot thrive Already I seem to breathefreer although so little distant from New York whose atmosphere rankwith foreign luxuries is like a hot house overcrowded by fragrantexotics stifling us with perfume We admire this city which however we have only been able to see in ourodds and ends of time Its24 situation is very fine it contains manyhandsome buildings and it is generally kept very neat A broad streetthrough the centre leads up to a pretty square surrounded by severalimposing buildings—the Capitol occupies a fine position here it is ofdark stone with a neat marble portico supported by four ionic columnsThe City Hall on the opposite side of the square is a noble edificebuilt of white marble from the quarries of Sing Sing surmounted by agilded dome The view from this dome is beautiful embracing the city atyour feet—green hilly country dotted with country seats and townsamong which is the city of Troy—the noble Hudson winding among thiscountry and a back ground of mountains The new State Hall is a prettybuilding—the Exchange is a huge mass of granite giving one a greatidea of the extent of business which requires so large a structure forits merchants What a different place is this to the town which stood upon this twohundred years since Then the only public building was a quaint oldDutch church with painted glass windows adorned with the coat of armsof those ancient worthies who clad in trunk hose and steeple crownedhats sat demurely below There are but few of the ancient Dutch housesleft and these are daily falling before the yankee spirit ofimprovement—which improvement by the bye sometimes merely amounts toalteration At this city is the southern termination of the great ErieCanal25 June 17th 1840 My dear E—We arose at an early hour and after looking into some ofthe public buildings we returned to breakfast This dispatched we droveto the rail road depot an ugly building at the head of State Streetwhere we alighted and stood in a large barnlike apartment among menand trunks and boys—the latter screaming Albany Argus’—‘EveningJournal’—and among all sorts of confusion until we were seated in thecars Soon however two fine horses to whom I render my thanks draggedus out of the barn into open day—up through the square over the hillto the Locomotive Depot giving us on the way many sweet little backviews of Albany and its pretty country and river and the round tops ofthe Catskills in the blue distance beyond The snort of a steampipe andperfume of grease and smoke announced the vicinity of our locomotiveand as if to show off its paces the engineer whirled the hideous thingback and forth before our—at least my—nil admirari eyes26 Our horseswere unhitched—the engine attached and away we rushed leaving ourfine steeds gazing after us with tears in their eyes to see themselvesoutdone by a great teakettle There are many pretty villas along the road breathing places for theheated citizens below which I would describe to you but dashing alongat sixteen miles an hour speed I can only catch a glimpse of whitepillar and portico when the next minute we are three miles away Youmust expect no description of the country when I am on a rail road forthe scenery is all blurred like a bad lithograph I only saw groups ofpine trees rushing past and several bright dots which I suppose meantwild flowers when we came in sight of Schenectady an antique dutchtown Before entering it I was struck by the vision of two immensetarred ropes walking deliberately beside our car and discovered we wereupon an inclined plain descending which cars of stone were brought upat the other end of our ropes Our steam horse was once more exchangedfor one of flesh and we set off upon a jog trot Near the city we passeda canal basin in which lay several canal boats for the Erie Canalpasses through here We entered the city crossed the end of a longstreet filled with bright looking shops where people and horses werefrisking about in the morning air—when another large depot received usin its barnlike expanse The Ballston and Saratoga train entered at theother end and you may imagine the charming confusion as the people ofboth trains jumped in and out the carriages marched and counter marcheduntil they had settled down into their several seats27 We were not suffered long to look upon this pleasant picture for at 9o’clock we were on our way to Utica We could see but little ofSchenectady while passing through it but it looked well at a distanceUpon an eminence above the town stands Union College a fine building ofgrey stone Schenectady is an Indian name spelt by them Schannaughtada meaning‘the Pine Plains’ a fitting name for the pine is universal here Thistown has been the property of many different nations—the Mohawk theFrench the Dutch and the English having each in succession ruled itsdestinies After leaving the town we entered at once the glorious valley of theMohawk which runs nearly westerly and whose course we followed eightymiles to Utica There may be lovelier vallies in the world butcertainly not another like this for it is unique in its kind Imagine along green valley covered with rich farms—through its centre a brighttransparent river having a rail road on one bank and a canal on theother while a range of hills frame in the picture on each side Sostraight is this valley that canal river and rail road run paralleland within sight of each other nearly all the way It was one of June’s sweetest mornings when we passed the shores of thepretty Mohawk and I was never weary of gazing down into its smilingface as we glided along or of watching the lazy canal boat draggingits rich freight at the foot of those soft green hills opposite or ofpeeping out the coach at the rugged cliffs which reared their bareheads far above our road There are many little villages on this route where28 we stopped torefresh ourselves or to fill the engine The first was Amsterdam asmall Dutch settlement Near this place stands a handsome stone edificewhich is renowned in the annals of New York as the residence of GreyJohnson and his brother Sir William the dreamer At these towns thereare hotels and at other spots refreshment houses built at the roadside where you are allowed a few minutes to rest You are shown intolarge rooms set out with long narrow tables bearing loads of coffeeoysters cakes pies fruit lemonade etc—you pile your plate withgood things stir around your coffee or tea when tingle goes the bell‘all aboard’ rings in your ears and you have just time to put your 25cents into the attendants hands and yourself in a car when puff andaway you go Some of these towns are pretty as St Johns FondaCanajoharie Herkimer and many others—What hungry people thesetravellers are at every refreshment station the tables were crowded andat the signal they rushed into the cars each with a cake or pie orapple to finish at his leisure We may say with Horace One would imagine he was speaking of our little Fonda which is herepronounced as Horace spells it It was named after the celebrated ColFonda Fort Plain is a pretty place on the other bank of the river here Ilonged to ‘stay one turn’ to hammer a specimen from the encrinallimerock which is found there The little falls of the Mohawk is adelightful place The river here forces its way through a rocky countryand falls over successive ledges of rock in pretty cascades The beautyof the scene does29 not consist in altitude but in number and variety ofthese saults and the foaming river rushing over its rocky bottom orwinding around its tiney islets and in the towering cliffs around itThe village is seated upon each side of the river connected by ahandsome marble aqueduct leading to the canal basin and by a neatbridge for carriages The scene as we approached was very pretty Yousee a frame work of rugged cliffs enclosing a noisy rushing river withnumerous cascades its shores crowned with white buildings and spannedby a noble bridge the canal boat is seen creeping at the foot of thehills opposite while the steeples court house and hotels are peepingfrom the trees which cover the sloping bank at our right Perched uponevery jutting point and grouped around the shores were many shantiesoccupied by the children of Erin who have kindly volunteered to make ourrail roads and canals When the train stopped before the hotel instead of the usual sound of‘Newspapers’ or ‘Nuts’ or ‘Apples to sell’ I heard young voicesasking if we wanted some diamonds Surprised I looked out and beheldseveral little girls holding up small boxes containing Quartz CrystalsWe of course became purchasers and found among them some very perfectand pure ‘Where do you find these’ I asked ‘Oh all among the cliffsma’am’ she answered in the Hibernian tongue—‘and if its stop ye wudI’d show ye to the diamond holes where I often dig up the ful of mypocket’ We observed this was a large town having several churchesdwellings a handsome court house and many large manufacturersGeologists tell us this was one shore of that lake of which thehigh30lands were the southern boundary How it came to wear through thesehills and run away to the sea no one can ever know The rocks here arelimestone principally but I observed there was with it some finegranite There was an old man among our passengers who had lived here‘when all this was a wilderness’ He amused us with some stories of pasttimes one of which I think interesting enough to tell you Here it isto fill up the page During the War of Independence there were two brothers who althoughthey were brothers could not think alike they joined opposite sides inthe war It happened while the Division under Gen Herkimer wasdestitute of arms ammunition and clothing he heard of the approach ofthe English troops Fight he could not fly he would not and he wasseeking some stratagem to better his situation when fortunately forhim the English brother having strayed too near his camp was taken upas a spy The brothers who had been long separated met once more butit was a bitter meeting for one was a prisoner and condemned to die Inspite of their different sentiments they loved each other The prisonerearnestly entreated his brother who was the General’s Aid to use allthe influence in his power to save his life The Aid was conscious hecould not succeed unless he made the ‘worse appear the better reason’for his brother had been fairly captured as a spy and in consequence ofsome bloody deeds of the enemy his life was to be forfeited With aheavy heart and darkened brow he entered the General’s tent ‘I know what you would ask ere you speak’ said his commander ‘I haveexpected you and have de31termined upon my course You come to ask yourbrother’s life—it is your’s upon one condition’ ‘Name it I am notafraid to agree to any thing my General may propose’ ‘I require you togo over to the enemy as a deserter—tell them exactly of our numbersfor I have learnt they do not imagine we are so strong conceal thestate of our arms and provisions and if I am not much mistaken theywill immediately withdraw when they know how large is our force You arethen to find your way back again as you can When you return yourbrother shall be free’ For one moment the Aid hesitated To appear as a deserter—to act thespy—to deceive even an enemy was adverse to his open noblenature—there was also danger of discovery when returning which wouldlead to disgrace and death ‘Well young man what is your determination’ asked the General ‘I willgo and trust in heaven and in you’ He sought the enemy’s camp wasimprisoned as a spy—but his feigned tale procured his liberation Theenemy retreated before so large a force which they could have conqueredif they had known their distressed condition It was many months ere theAid rejoined his General His brother was released and after a partingfull of sorrow they separated never to meet again We arrived at Utica at three o’clock and repaired immediately toBaggs’s hotel Here we found an excellent dinner just ready which tohungry travellers is a cheering sight As I promised to put down ourexpenses we pay 375 each from Albany to Utica eighty miles We hereconcluded to leave the train32 and spend a few days at the celebratedTrenton falls After partaking a very nice dinner at Bagg’s hotel weentered a neat carriage for Trenton falls 14 miles north of Utica Thedrive is a pretty one and up hill all the way We arrived at dark at asmall inn in a forest and were obliged to defer our visit to thecascade until the next morning After breakfast we walked out to visit the falls Our way was through adeep forest breathing forth sweet fragrance in the early morning airSuddenly in the midst of the woods we found ourselves upon the brinkof a precipice one side of a narrow chasm two hundred feet deep whiletoo far below to be heard a mountain torrent was rushing and foamingover the rock A range of five ladder stairways led down the steep—andas we thus hung over the water we felt very much like some ofShakespear’s samphire gatherers and thought what a ‘dreadful trade’ washunting waterfalls Safely down we found a narrow ravine so filledwith the roaring torrent that there was scarcely room for a pathwaybeside it Part of the way a chain was inserted into the rock that wemight by holding upon it pass the boiling whirlpool if our nerves arestrong enough to command our hands and feet—so scrambling climbingswinging we contrived to reach the uppermost cascade which is twomiles from the last one This stream called the West Canada Creekfalls down a deep ravine over successive ledges of rock in six smallcascades of great beauty The highest is only fifty feet high The sidesof the ravine are precipitous and covered with the beautiful foliage ofnumerous trees Among them are many evergreen trees—of these I remarkedthe33 stately white pine which grows over one hundred feet high andperfectly straight the red pine with its dark green leaves and yellowcones the black spruce and the lofty birch The rocks are slate andtransition lime stone of the silurian series abounding withpetrifaction of which many are perfect trilobites Quartz crystals arealso found here in great beauty and profusion This place has been thescene of some tragic events—one of them most pitiable A young girl satout upon a pleasure tour accompanied by her mother father andaffianced husband They came to this place no warning spirit pressingthem back no drear omen warning them away and no dream or presentmentchecking their steps Gaily they descended the stairs and clambered therocks—the lover with the hand of his betrothed in his the father andmother behind Being thus led along did not accord with her playfulspirit and telling him she could take care of herself she in an evilmoment withdrew her hand His charge to be careful was answered bysmiling asseverations of her surefootedness he turned with anotheradmonition and she was gone Where is she He looks in every directionShe has hid herself in play he calls no answer but the torrents roarshe has rejoined her parents he turns towards them and sees themquietly reposing together upon a rock His pallid look—his wildness asrooted to the spot he gazes upon them tells them the tale of woe soonbitterly confirmed by her pretty bonnet of straw which was at thatmoment whirled past their feet Oh the agony of those hearts as theystood beside that dark torrent away from all help and powerless tosave their beloved one The guide was des34patched to the village forhelp but not until three days after was she found a mile below hertender form having been thus far carried over rocks and whirlpools Another family party came to view these scenes A tender girl of elevenyears was for security consigned to the valet’s arms One false stepplunged him into the torrent—he struggled to the shore but theparent’s pretty fondling was lost to them in life The body was the nextday found As I stood upon the slippery rock while these events were floatingthrough my memory their scenes pointed out to me by the guide theplace lost all its beauty and the dashing torrent seemed some hugemonster seeking whom he might suck beneath his horrid depths I grewnervous and much to my companions surprise begged him to return Herejoicing in the fresh country air and released from the city’s dustran over the rocks with to me an alarming quickness and I turned todepart Why these beloved ones should be thus snatched away from theirfond relatives taken from their homes to find their death in this wildspot is to us unknown He who commanded this has purposes to usunscrutable perhaps it was to read a lesson to those who hear the taleto teach them the uncertain hold they have upon life and all itspleasures and to fear that power which can in an unlooked for momentbear them from life to eternity There are hundreds every season whostand upon this spot and hear this story and the heart which is notaffected by it must be as the hearts of the petrified animals aroundthem35 We spent several days here riding and walking among the romanticscenery The village of Trenton Falls is a small one containing a few shops andcottages and two churches one of which is quite pretty The ridetowards Utica is very beautiful The ground descends on each side to theMohawk valley and while our road wound down this side we had the wholeslope of the other side before our eyes covered with orchards andfields and dotted with villages The town of Clinton with Hamiltoncollege stands upon elevated ground while below at the river’s brinkis spread the city of Utica Here we spent a day looking about itsstreets and shops The ground slopes down to the river near which arethe business streets while most of the dwelling houses are upon themore airy and elevated portion of the city Genessee street is a finewide avenue leading up the hill lined upon each side with shopshotels churches libraries museums c The canal is here crossed by apretty bridge The houses were substantially built surrounded many ofthem by gardens and appeared very comfortable residences The businesspart of the city show rows of well built warehouses and were filledwith people and carts passing to and fro as if their trade was anactive one and their city thriving The Erie canal has brought muchtrade to this place which now is one of the most flourishing inlandtowns in the State The canal boats stages and rail trains which areconstantly arriving and departing give a stirring appearance to theplace Religion education and literature engage the attention of theinhabitants who support sixteen churches and many seminaries andliterary institu36tions The population in 1835 was 10183 to which nowof course several thousands must be added It is situated in OneidaCounty which was selected by the celebrated Baron Steuben as hisretreat and here he was buried June 21st—We left Utica today in the three o’clock train forAuburn About four miles from the city we passed a small town calledWhitesborough a pretty place with two churches an academy and abuilding called the Oneida Institute There is also here a manual laborschool A large unfinished building just outside of Utica we learnedwas to be a lunatic asylum calculated to accommodate one thousandpatients—God pity them Several pretty towns lay upon our route as Rome Manlius Canastolaetc Sweet retreats from the confusion of a city without the solitude ofthe country The canal and railroad which run through or near thesetowns present facilities for trade or travelling Rome is a place ofconsiderable importance containing five churches a court houseacademy several shops and dwellings The population five years sinceamounted to 4800 When arrived at Syracuse we drove up to a large goodlooking stone building bearing the name of Syracuse House There westopped to take tea This place is sixty miles from Utica enjoysconsiderable trade but is still in its teens having arisen since thecanal passed through that part of the country The Oswego canal joinsthe Erie here which with the salt works near brings them muchbusiness The population is 7000 We observed in passing through itseveral good churches37 a pretty court house substantial ware housesnumerous shops and dwellings with a lyceum and high school so that itwould seem the inhabitants ought to be wealthy refined and welleducated The salt springs are at Salina one mile and a half fromSyracuse where there are eighty manufactories of this material Thesesalt springs flow from beds of slate in some places two hundred feetthick Among the layers are masses of vermicular rock whose intersticesare supposed once to have been filled with salt In this region ofcountry are extensive gypsum beds water lime is also found inprofusion Sandstone generally old red and limestones are theprevailing formations of the county It was a beautiful evening when we left Syracuse The sky every whereof a clear deep blue paled gradually as it approached the west whereit was lost in a rich golden glow The spires of the town behind usreflected this brilliant hue and the country as we passed looked likeone of Turner’s one colored pictures Onondaga lake with the prettyvillage reposing upon its shore and the rich fields around it were alltouched with this golden pencil The fields were strewn with salt vatswhere the salt was undergoing evaporation which were covered with lowsheds probably taken off in the morning as it was now late Saturdayafternoon and this might have been to protect them from the weather Itwas quite dark when we reached Auburn We left the cars at the railroaddepot and were provided with carriages to the American Hotel Herelarge commodious bed rooms and luxurious mattresses received yourweary friends I38 lingered a while to write you the events of the daybut must now hasten to bid you—adieu Sunday June 22d—This morning we visited the first presbyterianchurch a large handsome edifice of brick The pulpit was neat and theseats and backs of the pews comfortably lined with horse hair From MrLathrop the clergyman we heard a very good discourse The baptist andseveral other churches struck us as very neat and tasteful Theepiscopal is in the gothic style the interior lined with oak andcontaining a handsome monument of Bishop Hobart who died in this placeThe hotels are showy handsome buildings particularly the Auburn Houseand the American where we have taken up our quarters This last isbuilt of grey limestone from that neighborhood and is surrounded by tworows of piazzas supported by handsome pillars Opposite to it is thecourt house quite a little palace in appearance It is in the Parthenonform with a portico and high pillars with the questionable addition ofa large dome From the cupola of an hotel we obtained a charming viewof this beautiful town and its environs ‘A palace and a prison on eachhand’ I exclaimed as I glanced around for behind was the grand courthouse and in front arose the gloomy walls and towers of our famousState Prison We saw from here the Theological Seminary severalhandsome churches hotels elegant private dwellings and streets ofshops while the outside of the circle presented a charming and variedrange of fields and hills and groves and streams It seemed indeed theloveliest village of the plain around and I expressed my surprise atseeing so large and39 well built a town ‘so far off’ My companion toldme it was too near the commencement of our journey to be astonished yetI had Rochester and Buffalo and Cincinnati to see This town has apopulation of nearly 7000 I do not know exactly but refer you to theGazetteers Those of our friends whom we visited gave the place a finecharacter for good society and told us they enjoyed all theconveniences and elegances of life with good pastors and good books Intwentyfour hours any thing can reach them from New York The prisonpresents an imposing appearance It is built of dark stone with gothicornaments and consist of first a high wall enclosing a large squarein the centre of which rises a massive pile of building surmounted by acupola This building is arranged on three sides of a square the centre276 the other 242 feet long In this are the eating rooms hospitalchapel and cells The work shops are erected against the wall leaving aspace for the keeper to walk around and gaze upon them through holes forthe purpose himself unseen It is a dismal life these poor creatureslead not only encarcerated from the world but confined alone andforbidden even to speak to a fellow prisoner when they meet at table orin the shops They pass the life of La Trappe monks except that it isagainst their will At table they sit in rows with their faces one wayso that they cannot even see each other However this solitary andsilent existence is said to be the best and most successful method ofrestraining and reforming the unhappy convict In solitude they havetime for reflection and silence prevents corruption from their fellowcriminals They have religious instruction which has con40vertedseveral I cannot but think it a very efficient arrangement The guiltyman is stopped in his mad career and solitude silence and time forreflection and religious counsel are blessings placed in his path Inthe mean while his bodily wants are attended to he is supplied withnutritious food well ventillated rooms with nurses and physicians Heis obliged to work and the fruits of his labor go to defray the prisonexpenses We saw carriages shoes cabinetware and various otherarticles made by them offered for sale in the shops of the village141 June 23d 1840 Dear E—At ten o’clock we entered the stage coach for Rochester 70miles distant Among our passengers were two whom we had found extremelyinteresting while journeying from Utica here—a clergyman ofMassachusetts and his daughter The Rev N T——r was about seventybut extremely active and very cheerful His conversation wasinstructive and agreeable and of course in a pious vein for he hadoccupied the pulpit 47 years as had his ancestors for 230 years backThere was such simplicity of heart about him such piety and kindnessof manner joined with elevated thought and deep learning that we lent acharmed ear to his discourse during the whole day Our route lay through an exquisitely beautiful country covered withcultivated farms and varied with pretty lakes and towns The first lakewe saw was Cayuga lake It is from one to four miles broad andthirtyeight long It is a bright sheet of water42 lying in a deepvalley and from its surface its shores gently rise covered with a finefarming country We crossed the end of the lake over a bridge more thana mile long So pure was the water that as we looked down upon it weplainly beheld the trout swiming beneath Leaving the lake we passed through the pretty villages of Waterloo andSeneca Falls Here the dark green Seneca river rushes foaming over a bedof rock in a fall of forty seven feet There are several mills andmanufactories upon its borders and we observed several churches anacademy and many shops Seneca fair Seneca Lake how can I describethe gentle beauties of thy varied shores and of that pretty town whichso adorns thy banks This lake and its surrounding country present avery lovely scene There is nothing grand about the lakelet you mustnot imagine it enclosed in the moutains of lakes George or Champlainthe style is petite and delicate Its Indian name was Jensequa whichhas been modernised into its present appellation It is a placidtransparent sheet of water of very great depth 4 miles by 35 long andis said never to be frozen over in the coldest winter The road layaround the end of the lake from whence the eye wound over its fairpellucid waters to its cultivated shores adorned with handsomefarmhouses and country seats and the massive buldings of the collegewhich occupies a commanding elevation near the town—and the towers andsteeples of the village peeping through the trees as if to catch aglimpse of the waters below We stopped at a small stage house in thelower and business end of the town where we all 43descended from thestage while the operation of changing horses and stages was going on Agood sized parlor furnished with gay landscape paper received the femalepart of the passengers while the restless mankind part repaired tothe shops to inspect the manufactures of the town or to refreshthemselves at the sodawater and icecream shops Once more seated inour stage coach we ascended the hill to the better portion of the townwhere we passed through the principal avenue of the place upon eachside of which were arranged those pretty villas and gardens for whichGeneva is so justly celebrated There were several churches in view anda new presbyterian half built This to us was an interesting object atoken God was not forgotten by the busy people below or the wealthyones around us Canandaigua with its lake and street of villas received ourcommendations There we dined at a very pretty and commodious Hotelhaving a fine view of the lake from its windows Some of the lake troutwhich appeared upon the table we found very fine This lake is smallerthan those we have passed being 14 miles long The main street is nearlytwo miles long and we drove through a mile of tasteful ‘gardenhouses’surrounded by grounds laid out in a pleasing manner adorned withflowers and fine shade trees The country from thence to Rochester isvery beautiful Spotted with farms and villages and woodlands coveredwith groves of maple hickory basswood elm and evergreen trees Itwas nearly dark around us when we were told the city was in view andagainst the bright evening sky we beheld in the distance the towers andspires of Rochester When we arrived we44 drove to the Rochester HouseAfter some refreshment we bade our companions adieu promising to meetat an early hour the next morning and drive over the town before we leftit for Lockport—and then were glad to rest for we had come a longday’s journey and in spite of good roads and commodious coaches finespirited horses and good drivers we were very much fatigued Well do the inspired writers compare man and his brief existence to aflower that early withereth—to a shadow—a cloud that quicklyvanisheth—one day here and the next gone Truly saith Job ‘thine eyesare upon me and and I am not’ a just figure of man’s fleeting lifeNever have I found the truth of these comparisons more striking than atthe present moment I told you of the amiable intellectual clergymanwho with his daughter agreed to meet us early this morning—when thatmorning came he was in eternity At two o’clock last night we werearoused by a messenger from Miss T saying her father was very ill Wefollowed the servant through the dark and lonely halls into the chamberwhere ‘the good man met his fate’ Yes all was over Around the room inattitudes of mournful musing sat the keeper of the Hotel some servantsand several ladies who had arisen to do all in their power to soothe thesufferer’s pains All had been done that was possible but in vain Uponthe bed lay a silent corpse whose countenance bespoke a death ofagony—it was all that now remained of that good and kind old man thattender father whose refined manners and intellectual conversation hadcharmed us so much the day before But his high intellect his talentshis agreeable converse of what45 avail were they all to him now hadthey not been joined to deep heartfelt piety and been devoted to theinterests of religion He had died far from his home with no friendsnear him except his daughter—his last hour passed away in a hotel amongstrangers—yet spare your sympathy for he died happy The everlastingarms were supporting him a tender father was waiting to receive him inthose heavenly mansions where death and sorrow can never come He wasgoing to no unknown region he was to meet no stranger face for hismind and his heart had ever been familiar with that celestial home nowto be his eternally—he knew a welcome awaited him from that Savior andthat God with whose spirit he had ever held communion through a longlife spent in devotion and in acts of beneficence It was the wish ofthe celebrated Archbishop Leighton that he might die at an inn thus tobe more forcibly reminded he was a pilgrim upon the earth—his wish wasfulfilled for he died at the Bell Inn London With what terms of praise high enough shall I speak of the people ofRochester When the news of this sad event spread they surrounded thebereaved daughter with sympathizing hearts and offers of service Thepersons belonging to the house and the boarders with many physiciansand clergymen with ther families were anxious to cheer the heart of thesad survivor and to lighten her mournful duties The services of theEpiscopal church were read over the body by the Rev Mr W a youngEnglish clegyman of great talent and piety The persons assembled nearseemed much affected with this solemn event May God bless this suddenprovidence to them46 and to us Uniting in a procession we accompaniedthe corpse to the canal boat where bidding adieu to Miss T we left herto pursue her dreary journey of five hundred miles accompanied onlywith hired attendants With what comfort did we see in her the power ofreligion elevating the soul above the trials and sorrows of lifeNothing else could have supported this bereaved daughter through soheartrending a dispensation But she knew in whom she believed She sawfrom whom the blow came and her faith told her it was done in mercy Aswe were to leave Rochester the next morning some of our kind friendscalled that afternoon and insisted upon driving us through the town Itbeing our only chance of seeing this celebrated city we accepted theirkindness although the scenes of the morning had unfitted us foranything but retirement As we drove along we were astonished at the extent and beauty of thiscity It was you know founded in 1812 and now contains 22000inhabitants We had heard of its rapid rise but supposed it mustconsist mostly of wooden buildings as is often the case in newsettlements and our surprise was the greater to find it built in themost solid manner Churches houses hotels and banks court house andarcade markets were all of marble or stone There are here fourteenchurches2 some of them quite handsome The Episcopal Church of StPaul’s is a fine gothic edifice of grey stone—the church which enjoysthe ministration of the Rev Mr W mentioned above is also handsomeof gothic form neatly edged with brown free stone—the pres47byterian isof grey plaster supported by substantial abutments—the baptist whereMr C officiates one of our active friends of the morning a neatbrick edifice—also catholic methodist and bethel for the canal menThe streets are many of them McAdamized There is a fine park heresurrounded by neat railings where the children of the neighborhood arebrought to take exercise But what most elicited our admiration were theprivate dwellings which in number and beauty are seldom equalled in ourcities They are spacious built of marble or stone in gothic orgrecian form surrounded by wings and piazzas and outbuildings andgrounds handsomely laid out adorned with shade trees shrubbery andflowers They are delightful retreats from the city’s dust and noisemake fine playgrounds for the children and altogether evince much tasteand wealth How much better is it for men of fortune to secure forthemselves and families pure air and room for exercise instead ofsqueezing as they do in our city into houses only 30 by 100 feet asis too much the custom in our cities The wealth lavished upon gayentertainments would procure space where their children might gainhealth and strength A frolic upon the green sward is much moreconducive to health than a sober city walk beside a nurse I often seethese palid pitiable little creatures in our streets walking as gravelyand demurely as some old octogenarian A child without gaiety is ascheerless as a landscape without sun The Genesee river divides the city into two parts and is crossed bythree bridges and the two aqueducts of the Erie canal The oldest ofthese is a very fine piece of hewn stone work 804 feet long supported byeleven raches They were building another aqueduct which48 is 858 feetlong and 28 in height3 and the music of the rushing river was almostdrowned by the mason’s hammer Beside this canal there is another called the Genesee valley canal fromRochester to Olean 119 miles The Genesee falls are very prettyconsisting of rapids through the city and in the suburbs it plungesover a circular rock into a deep dell The whole fall through the cityis 268 feet 97 at the cascade There is another cataract farther downthe river which falls 106 feet This is at Carthage two miles belowand here is the port at which the lake steamboats stop A rail road runsto this place There was not much water in the river and we did not seethe falls in their greatest perfection but still there was great beautyin the feathery foam which fell in snowy masses over the dark rockThese cliffs are old red stone and limestones—with feruginous sandrock and argillaceous iron ore supposed by geologists to be equivalentto the Caradoc series Upon the summit of the cliff opposite to us was arange of solid stone mills from whence we obtain that fine Genesseeflour ground from the wheat in the fertile region around Five hundredthousand barrels of flour are turned out in a year There are twentytwoof these mills The little streams which trickle down the rocks arestolen from the river to turn the wheels Our kind friends were anxiousto drive us to Mount Hope a celebrated cemetery a few miles from thecity but time was wanting for this and many other proposed pleasures Adistant view of Lake Ontario is said to be obtained49 from this hill Wereturned home through some of the business streets which particularlyMaine and Buffalo were filled with busy people waggons of home orforeign produce while the long ranges of shops were gay with dry goodshanging from the doors and piled with every comfort and luxury Stageswere landing or taking up passengers canal boats were arriving anddeparting and every thing we saw denoted a striving and thrivingpopulation50 June 25th 1840 Dear E—We left Rochester this morning at eight o’clock in a finestage and four horses for Lockport 64 miles distant for which we wereto pay two dollars and fifty cents each dinner on the road includedIt was with much regret that we parted from this interesting city foralthough we had been there but a short time we had seen enough to beable to appreciate its beauties and the sterling qualities of itsbeneficent and refined inhabitants We passed through several prettyvillages and observed with pleasure the farm houses and even themeanest cabins were decorated with roses geraniums honeysuckles andother flowers a pleasing custom which I wish was more followed amongus In one of the villages I think its name was Greece I observed aneat grave yard enclosed in a handsome stone fence and iron railingwhere ‘the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep’ while around the tombsthe kind hand of surviving friends had planted roses and droopingwillows A great part51 of our way lay over the famous ridge road anelevation of ground about as wide as a common road formed of sand andshells and which is supposed once to have been the shore of LakeOntario now about ten miles distant The ground has very much thisappearance as the land between us and the lake is much lower and levelwith marshy spots It is in some places covered with a dense forestThere is one thing however which struck me as singular the landdeclines the other side of the road also in some places leaving anarrow ridge to ride upon which is not the ordinary form of a lakeshore Why may it not have been a public road formed by thatindefatigable race of diggers the mound builders as a thoroughfarebetween two of their cities It might still have been the border of thelake but swampy and marshy ground If we are to believe MrDelafield4 these people were the descendants of the builders of Babeland when dispersed by the confusion of tongues wandered about the worldand at last found themselves in America Here they have thrown uppyramidial mounds in imitation of their ruined tower on the plains ofShinar The Arabs have a tradition that Nimrod disappointed in hispurpose of reaching heaven by building a tower constructed a chariotto which he placed a pair of wings and thus hoped to enter thecelestial regions Alas since the days of Nimrod how many like himhave sought to attain the courts above by their own strenuousexertions Dear me how I have wandered from the ridge road The celebratedtraveller McKenney believes this to52 have been the border of the lakewhich broke away and ran over the State of New York thus scooping outthe earth at the other side of the ridge The lakes Geneva CanandaiguaCayuga etc he believes to have been left by this flood This agreeswith Dr Mitchell’s theory of a vast lake having been once in this partof the state which burst through its southern shore at the Little Fallsof the Mohawk and through the Highlands flooding the coasts of NewYork with alluvion De Witt Clinton also in his Canal report remarks‘The general position of the Little Falls indicate the former existenceof a great lake above connected with the Oneida lake as the watersforced a passage here and receded the flats were formed above composedof several acres of alluvion’ In this alluvion trees are often foundtwelve feet under ground Darby observed marks upon the rocks at LittleFalls fifty feet above the river showing the water had once stood sohigh At a distance we saw Brockport upon the canal and soon after atGainesville we dined We reached Lockport at five o’clock in theafternoon and were shown into a neat comfortable hotel where we awaitedthe time of starting in the cars Lockport is a town of the mushroomorder having arisen around the locks of the canal within a few yearsThe churches houses and hotels looked very respectable and therailroads and canals gave it quite a stirring appearance The locks atthe canal here are a great curiosity There are five double combinedlocks which carry the canal over the ridge There is also a deep cuttingthrough the solid rock for some miles which is very interesting Manyspecimens of minerals have been53 discovered here as carbonate of limeselenite dogtooth spar petrifactions etc I promised to give you anaccount of all our expenses so I will mention now we are to payninetyfour cents each to Niagara twenty miles as I shall not think ofsuch mundane affairs while there Our expenses at the hotels have beentwo dollars a day each and meals fifty cents each at all our stoppingplaces Seated in the rail car we were soon on our road and fastdashing through a tolerably cultivated country with several neatmansions peeping through the trees I trembled lest the land shouldremain thus until we arrived at Niagara for I could not bear toapproach it through petty villages and farms but we soon left allcultivation behind and found ourselves in a deep forest While glidingrapidly along the engineer’s bell rang to scare some cow or otheranimal as we thought from the rail track Several of the passengerslooked out one pronouncing it a man another a cow until as weapproached we discovered it was an Indian female She was enveloped ina dark mantle from beneath which could be seen her scarlet legginsrichly embroidered with beads With a slow and stately step she pacedthe railtrack the engineer’s bell and shrill whistle unheeded Thatshe heard them was evident for another Indian woman her companion whowalked outside the rail stretched forth her hand as if in earnestappeal but the haughty young princess scorned to fly before hercountry’s foe The engine with slackened speed came near her andstopped then and not until it had quite stopped she condescended towalk off the railway As we passed I saw she was young and pretty andher dark eye flashed with a54 triumphant expression which said ‘Youdared not drive over me I scorned to be forced from the road by yourbell like an animal’ ‘Look out for the Falls Prepare for Niagara’ is the cry of all in thecoach My heart began to beat—does not yours Do be a little romanticand feel some emotion while about to behold one of Nature’s greatestwonders I looked out we were on the river’s bank a high precipice ofabout two hundred feet Far below rushed the river of a green copperhue or verdigris far up through the defile I caught a view of amountain of mist but I resolutely turned away for such snatches ofviews I have been told to avoid as bringing disappointment with themThe road swerved from the river and in a few minutes we found ourselvesin the midst of the little village of Niagara When the train stopped wewere surrounded by a host of porters struggling to secure us for theirseveral favorite hotels We chose the Cataract house from a friend’srecommendation and from its appropriate name We had no cause to repentour decision as its accommodation and attendance were every thing wecould wish We were shown into a neat chamber which to my delightlooked out upon the rushing rapids The tea bell rang as we entered andmuch to the annoyance of my impatient spirit my companion made it plainto me I should refresh myself before visiting the Falls Tea over I hadleave to go and we were soon upon the pathway Shall I take you at onceinto the presence chamber of the divinity or shall I describe the hallsand corridors as I pass through them to her throne I think a minutedescription will best please you Niagara river just55 before it reachesthe fall is divided into two parts one rushing past the Canada shoreplunges over the rocks making the crescent or horseshoe fall—thisfall is about one hundred and sixty feet high The other half of theriver passes around an island called Goat or Iris island and fallsfrom the American side This island has been sacred from the foot of manuntil a few years since when a bridge was thrown across the rapids withmuch dexterity and daring Upon this bridge we will walk if you pleasestopping one moment to view the rapids These constitute a verybeautiful feature of the scene and were it not for the falls would bewell worth a visit on their own account The river is a mile wide andcomes rushing and foaming over rocks some ten or twelve feet highlooking seafaring men tell us very much like breakers or a sea in astorm—the green waves heightening the illusion One is glad to besafely over this tumultuous water especially as the former bridge hasbeen carried away From the bridge you land upon Bath island containingabout two acres of land upon which is erected a tollhouse and shopfor the sale of Indian curiosities and canes There are also bathinghouses here A short bridge brings us to Goat Island onehalf a milelong and a quarter wide It is also called Iris and as such I shalldesignate it The increased roar the mist rising above the trees urgeyou on and you pass the ‘curiosity shop’ and refreshments here offeredand hasten on through many a winding forest path until you gain theopposite side of the island where you find yourself upon the brink of adeep gulf into which an ocean broken loose from its bounds isprecipitated with astounding noise and violence56 This is thecrescent fall on the Canadian shore But linger not here Descend theisland to the brink of the river and cross the rapids over a totteringfrail bridge to the tower which stands upon the precipice at the edgeof the falls Ascend to the top and lean over the railing look calmlydown if you can into the fathomless abyss of ocean where the waves aredashing the foam whirling and the winds rushing amid the roar of athousand thunders eternally ascending Deafened confounded bewilderedyou retreat in haste fearful every moment the breakers which aredashing against the tower will tear it away from its foundation andplunge you into the fearful ocean depths below At this place and upontable rock opposite you see Niagara in all its power and terror But ifyou would behold it in all its ravishing beauty you must go as we didthe next morning before sunrise and view it from the ferry house Toreach this spot you do not cross to Iris island but follow the riverbank to the American fall near which is the ferryman’s cottage and ata little distance the ladder which leads you down to the boat Seatedupon a rock in front of the cottage we feasted our eyes with unearthlybeauty Beside you is the American fall tinged with a delicate apple orberyl green hue One delights to follow with the eye this fairtranslucent arch as it plunges far down into the water nearly twohundred feet below us You have but a sideling view of this fall hereLooking past it you see the dark foliage of Iris island and beyond theCanadian fall This immense mass of water falls over rocks in the formof a crescent and is tinted with an elysian loveliness which you havenever beheld and never can57 conceive let me write pages upon it Earthhas never produced water of the like hue something of the emerald butmore rich more vivid This green spotted and embroidered as it iswith wreaths of snow white foam presents the most charming and uniqueeffect imaginable In some places the water pitches over perfectlysmooth as if an emerald arch and so pellucid that you may distinctlysee through it the white foam that is churned from the rocks over whichit flows As we reached the spot from whence this is seen the sun aroseabove the trees and immediately two glorious rainbows spanned the riverfrom shore to shore and the mist which was rising high in the air tookthe tint of the rose which faded only to be replaced by the mostgorgeous prismatic hues Never had imagination pictured any thing soglorious as that scene a tremendous fall of green and white water agay colored rainbow rosy mist azure sky and shores of various shadesIt was a creation which belonged not to earth It seemed as if thecelestial city was before us with its gates and walls of sapphire ofemerald of ruby and of gold The waters of life that flow through thecity of God seemed rushing past us for the scene was altogetherunearthly and our feelings were elevated to that sublime architect whocould create such surpassing beauty Earth and its cares home and itsjoys are all forgotten and we feel as if we could ever recline beforethe throne of that mysterious presence and watch untiring those cloudsof incense which are rising before it forever When we left the scenewe trod in solemn silence as if on holy ground The violence with whichthe water pours over the rocks has worn them away58 and the river hasbroken its way up from Lake Ontario at the rate of a rood in threeyears It is supposed when first discovered to have been near theClifton House on the Canadian shore and the ferry house at theAmerican June 26th—This morning we descended the cliffs by a staircase andcrossed to the Canadian shore The boat was tossed about like a shellupon the whirling waves and as they looked up at the mass of watertumbling so near them and at the boiling water two hundred and fiftyfeet deep under us some of our fellow passengers became a littlenervous My whole soul was so absorbed in contemplating the wondrousscene that I felt no terror A sentinel in the scotch costume greetedour eyes when we landed telling us we were now in a strange land amonganother people A winding walk up the cliff leads you to Clifton Housea celebrated Canadian hotel From the balconies of this house is one ofthe most imposing views of the Niagara falls You see the whole at oncewhile from the American side you see only a part at a time Still ifnot so grand the view is more varied and more beautiful upon theopposite shore and from Iris Island Every one says it is ridiculous toattempt to describe these falls but I have promised to give youdaguerreotype views and will endeavor to sketch the outlines—theshading and the impressions of the scene can only be given by theplace itself Imagine a crescent of water a mile long plunging withawful violence as if the foundations of the great deep had broken upagain from a cliff nearly 200 feet high According to McKenney15000000 tons of water59 are poured over the rocks in 24 hours A greenisland divides this fall into two unequal parts Table rock upon theCanadian shore is at the edge of the falls and projects over the cliffwhere you may stand with nothing between you and the boiling oceanbelow So close is it to the water that the waves wash over part of itand it is almost always covered with mist and spray If it be glory tobe buried in Niagara you may here hope for that fate as a portion ofthe rock has already fallen and a large crack shows you the remainderwill soon follow From this spot is said to be the finest view as theeye embraces the whole circle of waters but as it was one of the dayswhen the mist takes that direction I saw but little of this I foundmyself upon a slippery rock a shelf between heaven and earth withwaves of spray breaking over me and a furious mist dashing into myface—a noise of waters was in my ears a white foam rushed wildly pastand I felt as if caught up in the sky in a whirlwind and driving snowstorm We waded back through the wet grass and ran into the Pavilion toavoid the spray dripping from the eaves This house besides being acuriosity shop is the residence of the guide who will conduct you down along staircase and behind the fall if you wish—as I had no penchantfor being drenched half drowned and suffocated I did not attempt thisexploit We descended this morning the American side and ventured alittle behind that fall One feels very much as an Israelite making hisexode with a wall of water at his side ‘where the flood stoodupright’ When once in you see a glorious chamber with dome and walls of emeraldrendered transparent by60 the morning sun You might imagine yourself inone of those crystal caves where the sea nymphs congregate beneath thearches of the sea On the road from table rock to Clifton House thereis another building where there is a fine museum containing 4000specimens of Indian curiosities animals minerals c many of themfrom that region The trees about here are most of them evergreen Theregular yellow pine grows here and the silver fir with its white linedleaves and purple cones and the fan leaved larch growing 100 feet highThe rocks of Niagara are secondary limestone and sandstone aboundingwith veins and nodules of various minerals—among them selenitecalcareous spar—petrifactions—tufa from the cave and many others Ibelieve I have sketched for you every thing regarding thesefalls—gigantesque phenomene as La Vaseur calls them Still I do notexpect to give you any idea of them for no one who ever wrote conveyedan impression of the reality to me I might make a pyramid ofexpletives and when all the superbs beautiful’s majestic’s andtouching’s are expended you will say when you come ‘the half has neverbeen told me’ Many have been disappointed here chiefly because thescenery around the falls is not as imposing as they had imagined Somewould have a range of lofty mountains as a back scene or a crest ofnaked rocks towering above the falls but I fancy these are of the classof contradictionists who make a respectable figure in conversationmerely by opposing every thing They thus obtain a hearing are able toenter into an argument when no other means would gain them a listenerHe who formed this imposing scene is a better judge61 of the sublime andbeautiful A range of mountains would materially injure the effect asit would by contrast take away from the height of the water Thecataract would be a secondary object but seated as it is in a levelregion of country it is the first object that strikes the eye— a gemon natures forehead There are many drives in this neighborhood tovarious interesting places such as springs whirlpools battlefieldsc The parade ground is also a favorite place of resort A regiment of700 soldiers are reviewed upon the Canadian shore We hired a carriageat the Clifton House and after a short drive found ourselves upon abeautiful plain above the falls surrounded by guard houses andbarracks The plain was soon filled with soldiers who came marching upin separate detachments from every direction They were tall fine formedmen all of one height dressed in the Scotch costume consisting of theshort plaid skirt stockings laced with red cap and a cloud of blackplumes They were well drilled and marched countermarched and wentthrough all their evolutions as one man The dress is picturesque butmust be a cold one in these regions A pantaloon over the naked knee Ithink would be an improvement I could see soldiers although not aswell drilled at home so I was glad to turn my course towards thatrolling flood below From this plain is a fine view of the rapids abovethe cataract and of Iris Island which seems to have floated to thebrink of the precipice like one of the Mexican floating islands Wespent the afternoon upon Iris island In the little curiosity shop werefreshed ourselves with delicate white strawberries grown upon theisland covered62 with rich cream Here also we added to our stock ofIndian bags and moccasins Among the articles in the shops at thevillage I admired most a large living eagle which was chained to hisperch His feathers were black and white and his beak and claws yellowwith a ruff of grey about his neck I pitied the poor captive as hestood gazing sadly out apparently listening to the roar of the fallsand longing to be at large in his native forest once more The village of Tuscarora Indians is sometimes visited much againsttheir wishes however The Indian nations have never lost the remembranceof their former power and their present degradation They look upon usas usurpers who have wrested from them the land of their fathers andhave never forgiven us They count themselves our prisoners and areindignant that we should come and gaze upon them in their fallen stateas objects of curiosity Their village is built upon the high shore ofNiagara about eight miles below the falls commanding a fine prospect ofthe river and lake They are under the care of a missionary who has beenthe means of converting fifty out of the three hundred This tribe oncebelonged to the confederacy of five nations but came originally fromNorth Carolina and are living upon the proceeds of the sale of theirland there and their trade Some of them are prosperous industriousfarmers while the women embroider beautifully with beads and stainedporcupine quills upon birch bark and deer skin These they dispose ofat the shops and to strangers at the Hotels Upon these occasions I amstruck with the difference between this proud race and our own A pedleror travelling shopman63 comes in unpacks his wares holds up everyarticle insists upon its worth and beauty and urges you to buy—withthe Indian it is otherwise At our hotel while ascending after dinnerto the dining room one is struck by the sight of a row of dark beingssitting upright upon the settees in the halls envelloped in cloaks ofscarlet or black richly embroidered with beads or adorned by pieces oftin cut in flowers and tacked on Their eyes are fixed upon the groundtheir long hair falls over their faces and an expression of profoundmelancholy sits upon every countenance You stand before them and gazeupon them but silent grave and motionless they sit like the band ofconscript fathers awaiting the approach of Attila You at last ask‘Have you any moccasins’ with a dignified motion they throw open theircloaks and their laps are filled with articles for sale You ask theprice—a low musical voice tells you the amount in a very foreignaccent and that is all I could ever obtain from an Indian womanalthough I made many efforts while at Niagara and they can both speakand understand English I never saw but one of them smile I asked her what she had for sale inher lap—she threw it open and behold a pretty Indian cupid asleep in abirch cradle swathed and bandaged in their peculiar fashion Titaniawould have quarrelled for it At my start of surprise and admiration amoonbeam smile flashed over her face and then all was dark and gloomy asbefore The celebrated Timothy Flint tells us ‘the Indians are amelancholy musing race whatever emotion or excitement they feel goeson in the inner man’ So close an observer as he was and living solong64 among them his views can be relied on as being correct TheIndians have always been noted for their strong attachment to theirchildren and a stranger among them has only to praise the papoose towin his way to the parents heart June 27th—I could not have believed parting with Niagara would havecaused such sorrow The lofty and celestial emotions which are producedwhen in the presence of this one of God’s most beautiful creations youare unwilling to lose You feel ‘it is good to be here’—and you dreadto leave this holy ground to enter again into scenes which will do muchto efface these pure emotions A glimpse of heaven has been vouchsafedyou and most reluctantly you return to earth again Slowly we sat outthis morning to take a last farewell We had seen it in all itsbrightness and we now beheld it in a sombre hue The heavens wereovercast the mist once of a dazzling whiteness now took a dusky tintand hung over the cataract like a mourning veil It was more inaccordance with my feelings than to have bade her adieu while she wassmiling in the ‘bright garish eye of day’—one might fancy she was sadat losing such true worshippers But you cannot understand such feelingsnow they no doubt seem ridiculous—come here and you will experiencethe truth of such emotions At two o’clock soon after dinner we satout on the rail road for Buffalo The road for some time is laid alongthe river bank and gives us a fine view of the islands rapids andother objects of interest as Fort Schlosser and Chippewa—and then along low wooded island floating upon the bosom of the broad stream was65shown as Navy island the head quarters of the Canadian revolutionistin ’37 and ’38 The band have however now dispersed and the island hasreturned to its parent promising never to do so any more It contains7005 acres of good land The river now begins to expand from one mileto eight including Grand Island in the centre This is twelve miles inlength and contains 17384 acres of rich land and stately timber Aneat village called White Haven stands upon its shore containing amongother buildings a steam saw mill which furnishes ship stuff from 20 to70 feet in length A fine situation for such an establishment as thereis plenty of the raw material for this manufacture in sight all around There are 15 or 20 islands between the falls and Lake Erie some of themvery pretty adorned with clumps of maple oak or cedar Upon one ofthem Tonawanda isle is a fine mansion with cultivated grounds andfields around it Our road lay through a village of the same namesituated upon Tonawanda creek a small place through which runs the Eriecanal We had sufficient time to survey the beauties of RattlesnakeIsland at our leisure for when just opposite a part of our enginegave way and we came to a sudden pause The male passengers were soonout to discover the cause and came back with a report that we couldproceed no farther as the injury was very great We were declared to be‘in a pretty fix’ A horse was procured from a house in sight and a manwas despatched upon it to Buffalo about eight miles distant Many of thepassengers sat out to walk to Black rock 4 miles a head where theycould66 procure carriages to take them to Buffalo The rest of usremained seated in the coaches with a hot July sun streaming throughthe windows What should we do—scold at the road or the train or theengineers No an American never vexes himself about such things—he iscalm and indifferent under every circumstance Some of us fell toreading some to napping and some to rambling We undertook the latterbut as we were only surrounded by ploughed fields soon returned to thecoach where I busied myself in writing the above Pray read on if it isonly to repay me for my sufferings those two hours in the heat I thinkI had better abuse this rail road a little for it deserves it Do nothowever suppose I am vexed at being left thus ‘sitting on a rail’ Theiron is ripped up in several places causing a jolt when we strikeagainst these land snags and a man rides beside the engineer with ahammer to nail them down It is the worst rail road I ever travelledover however as it is only used a few months in the year when Niagarais fashionable perhaps it may not yield sufficient profit to allow muchexpense upon it Something is seen coming up the road—all heads areout and we hope to be released from our captive state—it turns out tobe the return train which had been waiting for our engine and cars andnow has been obliged to take horses instead As it was impossible topass us the passengers and their baggage were turned out and placed inour coaches to the Niagara end of which their horses were fastenedThey looked very sourly at us while this was passing thinking perhapsof the maxim of Pythagoras to his scholars—Do not remain in thehighway They wondered at us for sitting in67 their highway deprivingthem of their engine and condemning them to the loss of a fineafternoon at Niagara Some of them perhaps might have been of thatwhisking class of tourists who intended to return the next morningearly and to them it would be quite a loss A joyous shout announced the appearance of our horses and we were soonon our way again We passed through Black Rock a considerable villageand then followed the Erie canal for some distance The last two mileswere upon the borders of Lake Erie which stretched away a mighty mass ofgreen waters to the horizon As this was our first view of our great‘inland seas we gazed upon it with much interest There are manyhandsome villas in the vicinity of the town commanding fine views of thelake and city one of them a large Gothic stone mansion promises to bequite an ornament to the country if ever finished At Buffalo we droveof course to the American Hotel as its fame had reached us at home Itis a large stone building well kept and elegantly furnished Thedrawing room is as handsome as any in the country and the dining roomis a large airy commodious apartment lighted with five large gildedchandeliers The staircases and halls are of oak covered with copper insome places—the bedrooms private parlors table and attendance as goodas we could find in our boasted city There is here also a public roomhired sometimes for concerts and lectures which is well lighted withchandeliers and set round with green silk couches In fact every thingis good and neat68 June 28th—Sabbath morning—that blessed day of rest given in mercyas a moment of repose in the wearied journey of life to the ‘world’stired denizen’ We felt its benefit and rejoiced no stage horn couldhurry us onward and no bell save the ‘church going bell’ could summonus forth The presbyterian church is a plain building but handsomelyfitted up inside and very comfortable Rev Mr Lord is the ministeran able and pious man We heard in the morning a very interestingdiscourse from Mr Stilwell of the American Bethel Union He deliveredit in a Baptist church in which the Rev Mr Choules officiates when inthe city It is a neat commodious building the pews made of the nativeblack walnut cushioned and lined with horse hair A choir of goodsingers accompanied by instruments led the music The society to whichMr Stilwell belongs devotes itself to the sailor’s interest The stateof the boatmen upon the Erie canal he reported to be very wretchedThere are about 25000 boatmen and sailors employed upon the canal andin lake navigation who were of the lowest and most worthless class ofmen seeming inaccessible to all efforts for their reformation orconversion These mixing with the lower population of Buffalo andother towns on their route exerted a baneful influence The BethelUnion attempted to send missionaries among them but they were abusedinsulted and almost discouraged Still as they felt it their dutythese selfdenying men persevered every Sunday in addressing the menalong the canal and in presenting bibles and tracts They soon beganhowever to have some hope for when the canal closed last autumn therewere only two men who had re69fused tracts and only three who insultedthem With this success small as it was they were excited to go onhoping the Lord was smiling upon their labors The minister mostsuccessful among them had once been a canal boy himself and whilesitting upon his horse dragging the boat employed himself for hours ininventing new and strange oaths to surprise his fellow boatmen The mennow readily listened to him They were conscious of their degradationknew they were despised by all good men and never hoped to rise Seeingnow one of their number so bright and shining a light they trusted aboatman’s name would not always be an object of scorn These poor mencomplained to him that they had no day of rest as there was as muchforwarding upon the Sabbath as upon any other day The Captains of thelake boats were also obliged to struggle against this evil and in someinstances had renounced their trade upon that account or uponremonstrance had been turned adrift for some less scrupulous CaptainThe fault then seems to lie upon the forwarding merchants whom MrStillwell addressed begging their forbearance in this respect It is to be hoped this address produced its intended effect and themerchants who claim a day of repose for themselves have granted thesame to the unfortunate boatmen6 June 29—This morning we sent for a carriage and sat out to see thecity and make some visits Buffalo70 although suffering with all ourcities in the stagnation of trade seems to be doing a great deal ofbusiness The rows of shops and handsome warehouses seem to containevery article necessary for comfort or luxury It is a larger city thanRochester but has not its air of elegance and neatness The town wasburnt by their neighbors the Canadians in 1814 but has since beenrebuilt The streets are wide and airy Maine street the principalavenue is more than a mile in length The churches are neat buildingsone of them a catholic promises when finished to be handsome Thecourt house is a solid well built edifice having pillars up to the roofThe markets are very good also The city is well situated upon groundrising gently from the lake the upper part being covered with handsomeprivate dwellings which thus obtain fine views of the lake andsurrounding country and secure for themselves room for their gardenswhich are very prettily laid out There is here also a military stationfor the United States troops whose barracks comfortable brickbuildings are built around the parade ground and surrounded by a goodwall Our friend’s cottage was upon elevated ground looking down uponthe green Niagara river and enjoying a view of the lake in front andbehind an extent of country covered with the untamed forest It was thefirst time I had seen a forest landscape and I looked with muchinterest upon this vast plain of green leaves reaching to the distanthorizon a smoke curled in one spot telling of some settler clearing hisway through the green wood The handsomest private dwellings here do notaffect the Gothic or Grecian which had prevailed along our road butwere substan71tial square stone or brick buildings having a marbleportico in front an cupola upon the top surrounded by a fancy railingOur drive around Buffalo was very interesting and we wondered as wemarked such a mass of solid buildings and depots of articles from everyregion in the world and such throngs of human beings deposited in awilderness but a few years redeemed from the Indian the buffalo andthe bear What industry what energy has been employed to bring hitherall these materials Buffalo is a frontier town and grand portal of thewest through which is flowing a constant stream of travellers andemigrants This mixture of all nations in the streets give them anunique appearance Here you see the Indian beau with his tunic boundwith a crimson sash his hat surrounded by a circle of feathers hisdeer skin pantaloons richly embroidered in barbaric patterns whileribbons and tassels swing out from his dress at every step After himwill pass a band of United States soldiers then a rough backwoodsmanupon a horse looking as wild as himself its uncut mane and tail wavingin the wind as he gallops violently through the streets Then follows aparty of comical German emigrants a scarlet clad British officer aCanadian a Frenchman a wild looking son of Erin a sturdy ruddygaiter legged English farmer a Tonawanda squaw with her papoose uponher back and lastly the dainty lady traveller with her foreign abigaland fantastically dressed children Among the crowd I observed a curiousfigure—a one legged negro wearing an old uniform coat with ruffledcuffs ringing a bell most energetically The old English custom ofsending a bellman to proclaim72 the loss of any article prevails hereas in some of our other towns I believe ‘What is lost Sambo’inquired a person ‘Your wits massa’ he replied quickly setting hisjuvenile train off in a fit of laughter To another inquirer hereplied ‘My leg is lost don’t you see’ holding up the stump He is Isuppose a privileged wit who if he cannot set the table no doubtdoes the street in a roar The Buffalonians are a gay social peopleThe unamiable fashion of exclusiveness being very little known herefor living where the population is continually changing and wherestrangers are constantly claiming their hospitality they have acquiredan easy unsouciant manner and are ever forming social meetings toentertain the stranger Our letters procured for us much kind attentionand we had an opportunity of witnessing this free hospitable spirit Inthe afternoon one of our friends called and we drove down where afanciful yacht awaited us and a pleasant party of ladies and gentlemenfor the purpose of taking us over to the ruined fort opposite the cityThis is a favorite picnic haunt of the young citizens Fort Erie is uponthe Canadian shore opposite Buffalo just at the point where theNiagara river runs out of lake Erie It was destroyed during the war of1812 I have scarcely enjoyed any thing so much as that sail over Lake ErieThe lake is here five or six miles broad The water rushes swiftly pastas if eager to accomplish its glorious destiny of plunging over therocks of Niagara there to be a spectacle which nations come from afarto gaze upon We caught the excitement which seemed to animate thewater as we were tossed upon its wavelets with73 quick gay tiltingmotion and gazed with much delight at the novel objects around us Thecity with its numerous domes and spires the bright Niagara rushing andgurgling at a rapid rate over the ledge of rocks which once was Erie’sbarrier ere the waters burst their bounds—the gulls wheeling above usor floating upon the waves and above all that immense lake thatmighty mass of sparkling emerald water stretching far into themysterious west The air breathing from the fresh forest and cool lakewas so refreshing that I was almost sorry when we reached the shoreLanding upon a sandy beach we repaired to the fort where under theshadow of a ruined wall we seated ourselves upon the green sward andwhile refreshing ourselves with the contents of our provision basketsour discourse fell upon the hapless fate of those whose blood had dyedthe fair turf around us or upon other scenes which occurred during thatborder war But now all this is over conqueror and vanquished are bothbeneath the ‘clod of the valley’ the echo of the war trump has diedaway the green earth smiles again as peacefully as if it had neverdrank the blood of the dying and wall and bastion are fast crumblinginto their parent elements The lake the sky the shore are no longervexed with sights and sounds of strife Alas whence come wars andfighting among us Must these things always be Must earth’s childrenever thus hack and tear each other And we who are brethren whose homesare in sight upon either shore of this bright lake can we not dwell inunity They who have opposite creeds who differ in dress in manner inlanguage may and will rival dislike detest fight and exterminateeach74 other but we who are sons of the same father who speak the sametongue Oh must we be ever thus at enmity I have said this is a favorite place of resort and here a party of gayyoung people came to avoid the noise of the city and spend a quiet daywith their books and work upon the fourth of July Their little feastwas spread under the shade of the fortress and they were in the act ofdrinking to the day when they were suddenly taken captive by a band ofEnglish soldiers It was at that unhappy time when Canada was disturbedby revolutionary projects and it was naturally imagined they had comethere purposely to insult them It was an imprudent frolic and theypaid dearly for it they were marched off three miles to a militarystation where after being fully examined and no signs of revolutionbeing found upon them they were suffered to depart and return as theybest might I relate the anecdote to show how easily we may mistake eachother’s motives and how soon illblood may be brewed between those whoare suspicious of each other and ready to take offence While we were thus discoursing the sky grew gradually dark and a veilof blackness was let down75 over the lake giving token of a thundershower We were soon in the boat which tossed very much but we had ableyoung seamen who landed us safely just as the sun bursting forthsmiled at our idle fears An evening of social pleasure ended ouragreeable day June 30th—This morning we were again employed in rambling about thecity The situation of Buffalo is calculated to make it a greatcommercial mart It is upon the high road to the west and will commandmuch of the business of the lakes while the great Erie canal connectsit with the Atlantic This canal is indeed a ‘herculean achievement’ Itis three hundred and sixtythree miles in length forty feet wide andfour deep contains six hundred and eightyeight feet of locks iscrossed by several fine aqueducts and all this was completed in eightyears There are other canals connected with it This great arterybringing up the produce of Europe to the west through this city mustincrease its prosperity8 and population At twelve o’clock this morning embarked in the steamboat Constellationfor Chicago through lakes Erie St Clair Huron and Michigan adistance of twelve hundred miles for which we are to pay twentydollars ten each The wharves as we left them presented a busy sceneWe counted forty steamboats and canal boats beside several largevessels Among the latter was the Queen Charlotte a stately ship ofwar76 belonging to Canada but degraded to the ignoble fate of a Buffalotrader She had it is true lost some of her original brightness erethus fallen for she had been twentythree years under water havingbeen sunk in a naval fight on Lake Erie and lately raised The wharveswere loaded with produce and merchandize while carts boats and menwere loading and being unloaded We left Buffalo with regret Its majestic river and noble lake—its background of forests gay streets and social people have left a vivid andpleasing picture upon our memories A fine pier or breakwater as theycall it of solid mason work extends 1100 feet protecting the wharvesfrom the waves A light house stands upon the end of the pier When thecity had completely faded into the distant horizon we turned our gaze onour companions Upon one corner of the deck was a promiscuous heap ofchairs children pots kettles men and women being a family movingwest That old man with a cocked hat and large metal buttons the youngman in a blue frock and women with embroidered stomachers andindescribable caps sitting upon a pile of strange looking articles ofhusbandry and huge unwieldy chests is a band of emigrants from centralEurope A party of English gentleman from Canada were there bound upona hunting expedition to Wisconsin—another of Buffalo young men weregoing to while away the summer months in a fishing excursion upon LakeSuperior a long light skiff being part of their travelling luggageThere were also tourists for pleasure information and health likeourselves and some few going to inspect lands which they had boughtunseen Our77 steamboat is a very fine one although not of the firstclass There is a handsome saloon for the ladies surrounded by a circleof staterooms opening upon the deck—below are the eating rooms andgentlemen’s cabin the whole fitted up with comfort and elegance Thereare about 53 steamboats upon lake Erie some of them of six hundredtons and fitted up with every luxury and elegance many costing from15000 to 120000 each They are built upon a fine model and are wellfinished The upholsterer’s bill sometimes amounts to 4000 They aregenerally built very strong to resist the waves that run high here Thecomplement of men for one of these boats amounts to 40 the captainreceiving 100 a month After an excellent dinner we ascended to thepromenade deck which like our Hudson river boats is the uppermost decksurrounded with seats We were out upon lake Erie and gazed around uswith wonder and delight The water was a fine dark green which as thewind was high was tossed in waves crested with white foam or sparklingspray The shores were in some places low and wooded alternating withgentle elevations at whose foot ran a line of yellow sand—a sky ofpurest azure dotted with fleecy clouds was above What a lovely scene— asks Sir Walter This lake however is rather larger than his Scottishlake it being 290 miles long It has the character of being the mosttempestuous of all the lakes a fact we were soon able to verify for inthe afternoon the wind increased to a gale and the78 waves dashingagainst our vessel gave us each time a shock as if she had struck arock The ladies soon began to feel the effects of such tossing and one afteranother retired to their berths quite ill Fortyfive miles from Buffalowe stopped at the town of Dunkirk which is the termination of the NewYork and Erie rail road It commences at Hudson river 25 miles above thecity of New York a distance of 450 miles from its end This town underthese circumstances is rising rapidly It has a fine circular bayhaving two projecting points which protect it one and a half milesacross—and is one of the best harbors upon the lake There is also apier within the shelter of which five large schooners were moored Weobserved a rail road depot ready for the future engines and train—achurch tavern and a few stores Several little boys came on board withpails of cherries for sale which they disposed of at four cents aquart Here we landed a passenger an inhabitant of Dunkirk who duringthe voyage had been vaunting the advantages of his town The day wouldsoon come he said when he should no longer resort to Buffalo for hisgoods as the new rail road would bring all the trade to DunkirkDarkness drove us to our state room which we found replete with everyconvenience—a circumstance much to our satisfaction as we were to spenda week in it ere we reached our destined haven I would recommend you ifyou ever travel this way to choose as we did a state cabin lookingtowards the shore for these boats stop at every considerable town andof course keep near the coast In consequence of this arrangement wecould if inclined sit in our cabin and through the open door or79window behold the scenery at our ease while those upon the oppositeside gazed out upon an uniform waste of waters without a shore I thusobtained a sight of the town of Erie where we stopped during the nightAroused by the noise I looked from my window and saw the towndistinctly by clear starlight This town is in Pennsylvania and is thetermination of the Pittsburg and Erie canal In the canal basin besidecanal boats I saw a large steamboat and several schooners Presque Isledefends the harbor There was a large hotel brightly illuminated andsome stage coaches awaiting the arrival of passengers Erie stands upona high mass of Schistose rock surmounted by a stratum of clay—the wholeforty feet above the lake9 There is said to be here a neat courthouse and several pretty houses surrounded by trees—the streets are atright angles and the trade considerable There was a bridge spanningthe canal which I hoped was the one where the revered La Fayette wasfeted It was formed into a large tent by sails and flags which hadwaved in the battle upon the lake under which was a fine collationSeveral ships of war have been built here You will surely give mecredit of being a first rate correspondent when I leave my slumbers tocollect items for your amusement and edification July 1st—Early this morning we found ourselves off Conneaut whichwe looked upon with interest as belonging to the great state of Ohio Itis a small place at the mouth of Conneaut creek near the boundary linebetween Pennsylvania and Ohio—is a small80 but flourishing place Thenext town we passed was Ashtabula or rather its landing place the townbeing some miles in the interior A wooden breakwater defends theharbor A river of the same harmonious Indian designation empties itselfinto the lake sullying its pure acquamarine with a dark brown tintwhich could be distinctly seen a mile from the shore The day islovely—our boat glides swiftly upon her course On one hand we have aline of green waving forest coast where the oak the elm the lindenand the maple and stately yellow birch are standing in pretty groupsor gracefully bending over the water—upon the other we have a shorelessocean For miles there are no signs of human existence and then somelittle village appears with its invariable accompaniment a pierlighthouse and schooner We passed Fairport at the mouth of Grandriver and from thence the ground begins to rise being a band ofargillaceous schist which extends to Cleveland This is a beautifultown standing upon this formation mixed with sand and pebbles elevatedsixty or seventy feet above the lake of which it commands a fineprospect It was a pretty object in our view as we approached itssteeples and buildings crowning the summit of the picturesque cliff Welay here some hours taking merchandise thus enjoying sufficient time toexamine it The steamboat passed up the Cuyahoga river through twopiers each 1200 feet in length Upon each side the ground arose from theriver covered with the buildings of two rival towns Cleveland and Ohiocity The business streets are upon the banks of the Cuyahoga river andthe wharves were lined with vessels merchandise and native buckeyes asthe Ohio81 people are called after their beautiful tree Cleveland isbuilt upon a plain the streets running at rightangles wide and airywith a pretty square in the centre There are six churches a neat courthouse banks public library and many handsome dwelling houses Thepopulation is 7000 and several newspapers and periodicals are publishedhere10 It is 170 miles from Buffalo We had been a day and a halfreaching it on account of our frequent stoppages This being thenorthern termination of the Ohio canal a great deal of business is donehere Their trade in flour and wheat is very great they having exportednearly a million of barrels of flour in one season—cotton tobacco andother southern merchandise has passed up from the Ohio river through thecanal This canal runs the whole length of the state of Ohio toPortsmouth upon the Ohio river a distance of 309 miles It is forty feetwide four deep and has 152 locks11 The Cuyahoga river is sixtythree miles in length and running down over the sandstone ledges whichabound in that region it has a fall of 240 feet affording a fine waterpower From Buffalo to the borders of Michigan there is a band ofalluvion upon the lake shore from three to twenty miles in width Thisis bounded by a ridge of rocks 40 or 50 feet high once according toDarby and Schoolcraft the original boundary of the lake thus givinganother proof that these lakes were once higher than at present theyare This ridge is composed of micaceous limestone and82 schistoserocks covered with farms and groves of beech and oak which attain to alarge size Yesterday afternoon while sailing upon the lake we observedthese hills making a pretty back ground to the towns on the shore—nowit trends too much to the interior to be seen In this ridge arisewaters which flow each way some into lake Erie and others as theMuskingum and Alleghany into the valley of the Ohio This last riverbecoming the Ohio falls into the gulf of Mexico ‘upwards of twelvedegrees of latitude from its source’12 Successive ledges or steppesof sandstone rock lead down to the lake over which the rivers flow inrapids or falls making the scenery in that region very beautiful Wetook in at Cleveland several barrels of flour and nails and Selmasalt and boxes of merchandise—landed several passengers and thenleft this interesting town It must I imagine be a very delightfulplace of residence The Cuyahoga could be distinctly traced somedistance from the shore in a long dark line The swell in the lake still continuing most of our passengers hadbecome too ill to leave their berths A horse which was at the other endof the vessel also became affected Our German emigrants felt it leastas they had been seasoned by crossing the Atlantic I saw them seatedupon their packages eating brown bread and cheese as merrily as everTheir passage costs them little as they provide their own frugal fareand sleep upon their goods on the deck Several others pursued thiseconomical plan The emigrants from the German and Swiss nations areinvaluable to us and ought to be warmly received for in industry83economy and patience they set a very excellent example to ourextravagant people They always succeed their settlements and farmspresent an admirable order and neatness and yield a rich reward totheir patient labor The restless spirit the excitement caused by ahope of rising in the world of seeing no one above him which animatesthe American bosom and many of our transplanted brethren neveragitates them Where they plant themselves they remain and in labor andsocial duties pass the even tenor of their way The motion rendered itimpossible to walk or even stand unless supported and instead of beingunpleasant to me I have seldom experienced sensations so novel anddelightful My companion being an old traveller felt no ill effects fromit either Leaning over the railing we watched the vessel as shesurmounted one huge wave to sink again as soon The fresh westernbreeze breathing perfume from the forest clad shores exhilerated ourspirits and spread forth our starspangled banner in a bright canopyover our heads Two noble steamboats filled with passengers from the‘far west’ passed us with their banners flying the bells of the threeboats ringing out their friendly salutations to each other They aregone—the white foam of their track alone remaining to show where somany human beings had just been wafted away How glorious was thatsunset on lake Erie Dark and stormy clouds had gradually gathered fromevery quarter and now dropped down as a veil over the west concealingthe sun from our view and the lake is one vast gloomy abyss Butsee—some fairy hand has touched the clouds with gold and purple andevery gorgeous hue—the surface of the84 water is streaked with rose andevery wave is gilded The towers of Cleveland now distinctly paintedagainst the dark horizon are glittering as if cut from jewelry Ourfears of storms are vanishing when suddenly a black terrific cloudspotted with fiery blood color appeared in front of us as if theIndian Manitou had arisen from the lake to arrest our progress andforbid our farther entrance into his dominions Larger and larger itgrew until the heavens were covered with inky blackness A terribleblast lashed the lake into fury—the waves arose in their might as if toreject us from its bosom—our vessel careened fearfully upon one sideand confusion ensued Men hurried forward to remove the merchandise tothe other side and trim the vessel—women’s heads were from the cabindoors asking ‘what’s the matter’ and torrents of rain are surging overthe deck The awnings are buttoned down—all is proclaimed tight andright and we retired to our stateroom to listen to the wail of thewind and write our promised journals85 July 2 1840 Dear E—Rocked by the tempest we slept soundly but arose in time towitness a glorious sunrise scene upon lake Erie We were in the centreof the lake—no land was visible on either side save two lonelyislands one of which was just vanishing upon the distant horizon whilethe other one was only a short distance from our vessel Suddenly adazzling radiance shot up from the east and in a few moments the suncame rushing from out the water as if in eager haste to greet hisfavorite lake A flood of glory lighted up the green depths of Erietinging the foam with a thousand prismatic hues and tipping with goldthe white plumage of the birds which were soaring over our heads Thedark alleys of beech maple and hickory which covered the island andits pebbly shore covered with diamond spray were illumined with themorning rays receiving new beauty from every touch We were stretchingfrom Sandusky bay upon the Ohio shore to the Detroit river many islandswere86 passed some of them quite large Cuningham island contains 2000acres They are of limestone rock covered with forest trees Here wasthe scene of the famous naval battle upon lake Erie and these peacefulglades once echoed with the cannon’s roar I regretted not seeingSandusky a large and pretty town situated upon a river and bay of thesame name Here also is the mouth of the Maumee river or the Miami ofthe lakes northern termination of the great canal which commences atCincinnati and is connected with the canals of Indiana Land began to appear upon our western quarter and soon the State ofMichigan became visible The mouth of Detroit river was soon after seenhere five miles wide from the Canadian shore to Michigan AtAmherstburg a small Canadian town we stopped about seven o’clock forthe purpose of taking in wood The flashing of bayonets and the reduniform as the sentinel walked up and down the wharf told us we werein a land belonging to another nation Fort Malden is passed soon afterUpon a platform in front of the fortress a file of soldiers were goingthrough their exercises their brilliant scarlet dresses and armsprettily flashing back the morning sun A boat filled with redcoatedsoldiers was passing over to an island to relieve the guard which stoodupon a romantic point near his little sentry box A large ship camerapidly down the river with all its sails out looking like a huge birdof prey winging his flight to the shore adding to the variety of thescene Detroit is a beautiful river connecting lakes St Clair andErie Its width is generally about a mile—opposite Detroit citythreefourths of a mile The shores are very beauti87ful cultivated uponeach side with several pretty islands in the centre Upon the Canadianside we observed several French settlements their windmills upon everypoint giving a novel and unique effect to the scene We did not reachDetroit until ten o’clock although it is only 19 miles from the mouthof the river owing to our delay in taking in wood The city appearedwell covering a plateau of ground elevated 40 feet above the riverThree steamboats were in sight as we approached one being a ferry boatto the town of Sandwich opposite As we were to remain here some timewe landed and walked about the city The city stands upon a plain whichcommands an extensive view of the river and surrounding country A broadstreet runs through the centre called Jefferson avenue lined on eachside with shops and hotels At the upper end are several handsomedwellings surrounded with gardens The churches are common in theirappearance except the catholic which I must say was uncommon It is alarge building of unpainted wood having two odd looking steeplesexactly alike in the centre of the front at the back is a dome havingon each side a belfrey Adjoining this is the residence of the Bishop alarge brick building I was disappointed in the appearance of this cityIt was built by the French you know in 1670 and being so much olderthan Rochester or Buffalo we naturally supposed it would be larger thanit is But the same causes do not operate here which influence theprosperity of the other cities It has not the old and settled state ofNew York behind it nor the great canal Michigan of which Detroit isthe capital has been recently settled and that only in the southernparts The fur trade was for years its88 main dependence and that has oflate fallen off very much As man invades the recesses of the forestthe animals retreat before him Detroit has however felt the wind inher sails and is rapidly following after her southern sisters Of thisthe increase of population is one proof—2222 being their number in1830 and 1839 9278 Several railroads are planned out which whenthe river and lakes are filled with ice will be of much service Ofthese the Detroit and St Joseph are the principal—leading from thiscity across the State to lake Michigan a distance of 194 miles 33miles are completed Many persons take this route to Chicago inpreference to the more extensive one around the lakes Besides thesethere are in contemplation the Detroit and Pontiac Shelby and Detroitc Michigan will soon fill up as its population has increased since1830 seven hundred per cent then it was 28600 and now in 1840they count 211205 Detroit will then be the great depot of the lakesand bids fair to rival the neighboring cities Here we landed our Germanemigrants who were bound to the rich plains of Michigan Upon the wharfwere men busily engaged packing white fish salted with barrels fiftyof which we took on board The white fish is a delicious fish somethingthe form of our shad averaging from 4 to 10 lbs and sometimes weigh 14lbs There is a great trade of this fish upon the lakes 30000 barrelswere exported from Cleveland this season While passing the city whenwe had resumed our voyage we observed several rows of handsome warehouses many of which seemed as if newly erected We also noticed alarge brick building erected for the hydraulic works which supply the89city with water it being in these lakes fit for cooking washing anddrinking This city is the scene of one of Pontiac exploits He was oneof those brave and haughty spirits who cannot accustom themselves to theyoke of the white men Of these a few have appeared in latter yearsBlack Hawk being the last The French he had become accustomed to andsuffered their presence in his realms but when another nation appearedhe determined to root them out the land They were at peace apparentlybut a deceitful peace for Pontiac was organizing a confederacy againstthe English who then occupied Detroit ‘There was no sounding of thetocsin no alarm of war given no motion of the waves were felt’ toquote the words of McKenney—‘In this moment of stillness a scoutreturned bringing the intelligence that a large body of Indians werecrossing lake St Clair in canoes and coming in the direction ofDetroit while numerous bands were appearing at every point’ Pontiacappeared in the neighborhood with 3000 warriors who in a friendlymanner approached the fort erected their wigwams and commenced theirIndian games to lull all suspicion That very band unknown to theEnglish had just returned from the bloody massacre of FortMichilimackinack which they had surprised in the manner they nowintended Major Gladwin however suspected them and admitted only sixIndians at a time in the fort The wily Pontiac at length succeeded inhaving a council held at the fort and was permitted to attend withthirtysix chiefs Their rifles were cut short and hid under theirrobes with which they were to shoot down the officers and seize thefort Were it not for the fidelity of a squaw to90 her master in thefort the plan would have succeeded As it was they suffered severelyfrom famine and many were cut off who came to reinforce them beforethe Indians finally retreated Ten miles from Detroit the rivergradually expands into lake St Clair A pretty lake—a most sweetlake—appearing small among its larger sisters and yet it is 90 milesin circumference The waters are cool and transparent fringed with thegraceful ash the linden ‘tasseled gentle’ the beech and the statelylioriodendron and many other varieties We felt reluctant to enter andruffle the glassy surface and disturb the profound repose which reignedaround The shores are low and there are no houses in sight A woodcutter’s hut and at its extremity a lighthouse were the only signsof life we saw The trees were throwing their flickering shadows uponthe placid water or leaning over as if to admire their own reflectionso perfectly painted upon the mirrored surface— If you do not choose to emigrate to any of those charming spots I havementioned along the road if Auburn or Rochester or Cleveland do notlure you perhaps you would like to come to the picturesque shores ofSt Clair and weave you a bower ‘in some sweet solitary nook’ underthose trees of ‘ancient beauty’ or erect a picturesque hermitage with apet skull and moralize and spiritualize your hours away I have heardmany declare they could better worship their Creator in the fields andwoods than in temples made91 with hands and can ‘look from nature up tonature’s God’ I fear such are greatly deceived in the nature of theirfeelings and many a lonely anchorite has thus mistaken adoration of thebeauties of creation for worship of its Creator His heart may be filledwith the most elevated emotions while contemplating the glory andgrandeur of God’s works and he may be subdued to tears of tendernesswhile reflecting upon that kindness and mercy which has adorned theresidence of man with such exquisite loveliness but will thatregenerate his heart will it give him a knowledge of his Savior shewhim the mysteries of faith and redemption and subject his will to thatof Christ If so let him live upon a mountain top and gaze at willbut I much fear these sentiments are but the ‘semblance of sacredness’ The shores of St Clair being low display the rise which has takenplace in these northern lakes That there is a rise and fall in thissingular mass of fresh water has been observed for many years and manyopinions have been hazarded as to its cause Some of the Indians declarethere is a regular rise and fall every seven years while the scientifictraveller Darby tells us there is a rise once in fifty years Aperson upon whose knowledge we could rely told us at Buffalo oneyear while he resided upon the banks of the St Lawrence the currentran out of lake Ontario at the rate of ten miles and the next year thelake had unaccountably risen and ran thirteen miles an hour It musthave been one of those extraordinary floods of course much higherwhich caused the lakes to overflow as I have mentioned above—that isif it were not a diluvial torrent The captain of our steam92boat whohad navigated these lakes for several years a man of intelligence andintegrity agreed with the Indians in the belief of a gradual rise andfall in seven years During these last two years the water has risen tothe height of five or six feet Our captain pointed to many spots uponthe shore where the water had overflowed the land Upon one prettyplace a farm house had been abandoned and a fine apple orchardstanding two years in the water had been destroyed and now while allaround was green their limbs were bare and leafless A very intelligentman a settler upon the river St Clair pointed to several noble mapleand beech trees as we passed the Michigan shore whose gradual decay hehad watched while making his spring and fall trips in order to purchasegoods in New York It was pitiable he said to behold such goodlytrees ‘green robed senators of ancient woods’ sinking beneath thesubtle destroyer as some noble heart withering away at the touch ofaffliction He watched them with an interest he would a friend consumingunder a slow decay—their glorious beauty dimmed and faded until alifeless skeleton alone remained This man’s history interested us much and I will relate it for youredification He was a native of our city of New York one of a largefamily straightened for means While quite young he had married andstruggled for years to support his family respectably but sickness and‘bad times’ rendered his lot a gloomy one Hearing so often of thehappiness and pros93perity of ‘the west’ he resolved to remove thitherand accordingly bought a tract of land upon St Clair river thenfarther west than it now is He came here twenty years since with awife and several young children and a mere trifle in money A littlevillage has now risen around him of which he is the owner He has builta good tavern for travellers which he rents out has erected asawmill a few shops and houses and a little church His children aremarried and settled around him and he is as he expressed himself‘independent of the world’ Once a year he goes to New York or Buffaloto purchase goods for his shop How much better is this state of thingsthan to remain struggling for a morsel among the hungry crowd of alarge city I asked him if he never repented renouncing a city life‘No indeed’ he answered—‘I go there once or twice a year to transactbusiness but hurry away for I feel as if in prison I want elbow roomand never breathe free until threading my green lakes and vast forestsagain I am glad to leave such fictitious existence where each manmodels his conduct upon that of his neighbor and dare not act as hisspirit prompts him’ We had passed into St Clair river and aboutsundown dropped this man and his goods at his little village which wasseated upon a green slope cut out of the forest upon the Michiganshore The houses were surrounded by little gardens and seemedcomfortable The sign of the village inn was swinging in the summer breeze atraveller had just alighted from his horse in front of the piazza andthe steam from his mill was rising high above the trees tinted purple inthe evening light From a shop door a young man94 probably his sonaccompanied by a neighbor stepped forth to greet him while from thehoneysucklecovered porch of a neat cottage a woman whom I fancied hiswife was looking eagerly out to watch his approach Every thing denotedindustry cheerfulness and independence Soon after leaving the village of Clay we observed a ship at anchornear the shore quite a picturesque object It proved to be theMilwaukie a ship of three hundred tons burthen bound from Buffalo toChicago It was waiting for wind or steam to enable it to enter lakeHuron as this lake pours into the river St Clair with so strong acurrent that vessels can seldom stem it without a strong wind She wassoon attached to our steamboat and we both passed swiftly along What asuperb western sky The sun has long left us and yet we scarcely missits light so golden and so brilliant is the mantle he has left behindhim It is nearly nine o’clock and yet I can see to write this butfatigue drives me to my cabin and forces me to say adieu untiltomorrow July 3d—Still in the river St Clair We stopped some hours in thenight at Newport to take in a supply of wood The captain purchasedeighty cords at 150 a cord He told us it was his opinion thesteamboats upon these waters would soon be obliged to burn coalalthough surrounded by such a world of trees as there is so much timewasted in stopping for it I did not regret our detention as I wasanxious to lose no part of a scenery to me so novel and pleasing Thisis a beautiful river about sixty miles long and half a mile broadhaving several little towns upon it95 Cotrelville and Palmer we had alsopassed in the night the latter a thriving place from which a rail roadis contemplated to Romeo twentysix miles there to meet the Shelby andDetroit rail road A communication will thus be continued with Detroitthrough the winter The country upon the Canadian shore is wild anduninhabited while the Michigan side of the river is frequently adornedwith fields of grass or wheat or thrifty orchards The houses areplain but seemed surrounded by every comfort Our course ran quite nearthis shore so close that I might fancy myself transported into themidst of a farm yard with all its morning business going on A prettywhite wood house is before me now surrounded by fields and barnshaving a row of cherry trees in front whose fruit is glistening red inthe morning sun In the barn yard a man is chopping wood to cook thebreakfast I suppose—another is busy hoeing in a potatoe field—a boyis leading a horse down to the river for water while numerous otherchildren are arrested in their play and stand open mouthed gazing atus—ducks are dabbling in the wavelets—pigs are rooting up the turf—aflock of geese are running down the bank at us with beaks and wingsextended in a warlike attitude—while a sober cow chews her cud under alarge hickory nut tree The next moment all is gone to give place tothe silent groves of oak maple and ash Upon a long narrow island nearthe Canadian shore my eyes were attracted by what seemed a row ofhaystacks I enquired the meaning and was told I was looking upon anIndian village and these were wigwams I was delighted to behold averitable Indian lodge and to see real Indians instead of thosehalf96 civilized beings I had met at Niagara They are a body ofChippeway Indians who reside upon Warpole Island under the care of aMissionary of the Methodist church Their wigwams consisted of polesmeeting at top around which coarse matting formed of reeds isfastened From the apex of these cones smoke was rising telling ofculinary operations going on within Around each lodge was a small patchof potatoes or corn A small church with the missionary cottage and afew log cabins were in the midst Groups of Indians were lounging uponthe bank gazing at us while others unconcernedly pursued their usualoccupations of fishing or hoeing How much more graceful were those wildsons of the forest than the civilized men I had observed upon theshores I had passed Their mantles of cloth or blanket stuff trimmedwith gay colors were gracefully thrown around them and theirornamented leggins or moccasins glittered as they walked How dignifiedis the tread of an Indian we remarked as we passed the island many invarious occupations and attitudes yet they never moved awkwardly norsprang nor jumped in a clumsy manner The missionary cottage was anobject of great interest to us I had often read of these selfdenyingdisciples of Jesus but never before looked upon the scene of theirlabors Here in this lonely shore away from all they love—theirfriends and home—and almost shut out from the face of civilized manthey spend their days in laboring to ameliorate the lot of these unhappychildren of the forest In bringing them to the feet of their masterthey are indeed conferring a blessing upon them past all return As arecompense for the bright land their97 fathers have taken from thebereaved Indian they are leading them to another brighter and morelasting There is no change nor shadow of turning—there no enemy candestroy their homes—there the tears are wiped from their eyes and alltheir sorrows soothed Noble missionary who can appreciate thysacrifice None but those who have come from a civilized land wherethou hast passed thy early days and who now sees thee among the endlessforests with no associates save those wretched savages can understandthe greatness of thy disinterestedness During the short summer aresidence may be tolerable but when the rivers and lakes are choaked upby ice the short glimpse he has obtained of his fellow man whilewhirled past in a steamboat will be denied him The roar of the winterwind will shake his cottage and the wolf will scare him from hisslumbers But what are earthly joys or sorrows to a child of Christ Hismeat and drink is to do the will of him that sent him and in return forthe comforts and pleasures of civilized life he receives a peace ‘theworld cannot give’—a joy David in all the glory of his kingly lifesighed for when he prayed ‘Give me the joy of thy salvation’ A smallsettlement is formed at the mouth of Black river called Port Huronwhich is to be the termination of another canal across the state Here we found another vessel waiting for wind It was the brig RockyMountain bound to Green Bay being attached to our other side we passed‘doubly armed’ Near the point where the river leaves lake Huron standsfort Gratiot an United States military station whose white walls andbuildings over which the98 American flag was waving looked out brightlyfrom among the dark forest of the Michigan shore A line of blue coatswere going through their morning drill and a few cannons looked outfiercely upon us A small white Gothic church and a cottage stood nearthe whole making a pretty cabinet picture The river now narrowed to aquarter of a mile upon each side a point—the American side crowned bya lighthouse and the Canadian by a cluster of Indian cabins A barkcanoe paddled by five Indians pushed off the shore and came after uswith the greatest rapidity their long black hair flying wildly behindthem Our two vessels retarded our motion a little so that the Indiansovertook us and kept at our side for some distance They used theirpaddles with astonishing quickness and we were surprised to see them intheir ‘light canoe’ keep pace with our large steamboat It was howeverfor a short distance only—they were soon fatigued with such greatexertion and turned towards the point and sprang out or ratherstepped out with the greatest dignity drew the canoe to the shore andthen squatted down upon the bank evidently enjoying their race I usethe above inelegant word as being very expressive of their posture TheIndian never sits down as we do—with his feet close beside each otherand his body erect he sinks slowly down—his blanket is then thrownover his head and around his feet so that nothing is seen except hisdark glaring eyes Through the narrow pass before mentioned between thetwo points the waters of Huron run with a swift current Here we werefurnished with another evidence of the rise of these waters An officer of the army and his wife were our fellow99 voyagers veryintelligent and agreeable persons They had been stationed at fortGratiot a few years since and had frequently roved over the beacharound the lighthouse in search of the pretty silecious pebbles agatecamelian and calcedony which are often found upon these shores Totheir surprise they now found their favorite point ‘curtailed of itsfair proportions’ by a rise of nearly five feet of water Our steamboatand its two ‘tenders’ passed between the points out of St Clair riverand we found ourselves at once in a large and shoreless lake withnothing in front between us and the bright blue sky which touched thegreen waters in the far horizon beyond The transition is so sudden fromthe narrow opening to the boundless lake as to produce a grand andexciting effect Once out upon the calm waters of Huron our two guestswere loosened from their tackles and spreading their huge wings theypassed one to each shore and we soon left them far behind About anhour after the bell of our steamboat startled the still lake with itsclamors denoting the approach of some vessel We looked out in time tosee the noble steamboat Great Western rush past us as if upon the wingsof a whirlwind She was on her way from Chicago to Buffalo Her bellanswered ours and the deck was crowded with passengers One of thesestanding alone by himself and taking his hat off attracted our noticeand we discovered in him an old acquaintance from New York Thesemeetings in a distant land are very interesting carrying our feelingsat once to the home we had left This steamboat is one of the largestupon the lakes is finished in a style of great100 elegance and is saidto be as long as the English steamship of the same name This whole day since ten o’clock—we have been passing through Huronunder a cloudless sky The lake is two hundred and fiftyfive mileslong and its waters are of a deeper tint than those we have passedowing to its great depth as we are sailing over nine hundred feet ofwater while in some places it is said to be unfathomable The color isa dark olive almost black and it is only when the sun shines throughthe waves that we can perceive they are green The cause of the variouscolors of water has produced many a hypothesis Sir Humphry Davy tellsus the primitive color of water is like the sky a delicate azure13He says ‘the finest water is that which falls from the atmosphere—thiswe can rarely obtain in its pure state as all artificial contact givesmore or less of contamination but in snow melted by the sunbeamsthat has fallen upon glaciers themselves formed from frozen snow maybe regarded as in its state of greatest purity Congelation expels bothsalt and air from water whether existing below or formed in theatmosphere and in the high and uninhabited region of glaciers therecan scarcely be any substances to contaminate Removed from animal andvegetable life they are even above the mineral kingdom’ Water frommelted snow then considered as the purest Sir Humphrey goes on todescribe its color ‘When a mass is seen through it is a bright blueand according to its greater or less depth of substance it has more orless of this color’ ‘In general when examining lakes and masses ofwater in high mountains their101 color is the same bright azure CaptParry states that water in the Polar ice has the like beautiful tint’The brown green and other colors of rivers he imputes to substancesover which they flow as peat bogs vegetable and mineral substances Heallows the sea cannot be colored from any thing upon the bottom butimputes the tint to the infusion of iodine and brome which he hasdetected in sea water the result of decayed marine vegetables Of thisprimitive water are our lakes formed originating as they do in regionsof snow and ice Lake Superior from whence they flow is a vast basinof trap rock of volcanic origin14 It is the most magnificent body ofwater in the world five hundred miles long and nine hundred deep andperfectly pellucid Into this pure and originally azure primitivewater there flow forty rivers upon the south side alone according toMr McKenney of the Indian department who counted this number from StMary’s to the river St Louis These rivers he tells us are all ambercolored Why then may not these yellow rivers flowing into blue waterproduce green You see I like to hazard a hypothesis as well asothers I hope you will not call this absurd Col McKenney himselfimputes the green color to reflection of the ‘rays of light passingthrough the foliage of the shores conveying their own green hue untothe surface of the water from which they are reflected’ This might bethe case in small rivers or lakes but it cannot thus tint such a vastextent of water A writer in the American Journal of Science is ofopinion the color of water is reflected from the sky and is blue dullblack or102 golden as the sky may be—and that ‘green is produced inwater by the yellow light of the sun mixed with the cerulean bluethrough which it shines’ On the contrary the Count Xavier deMaistre15 does not impute the color of water to any infusedsubstance nor to reflection from above but reflection from the surfacebelow ‘as the blue color of the sky is owing to reflection from theearth beneath’ ‘Limpid waters when they have sufficient depth’ saysthe Count reflect like air a blue color from below—and this arisesfrom a mixture of air which water always contains to a greater orlesser amount This blue color being the primitive hue of water issometimes clouded or lost by earthy infusion or reflections from acolored sky The green tinge which he sometimes observed in water hetells us is occasioned by reflection from a white surface below Thishe proves by his experiment of a sheet of tin painted white let downbeneath the water—and his description of the water in the beautifullimestone grotto on the shore of the Mediteranian at Capri The greentint observed in the ocean is only seen when it is so shallow as toreflect the sun’s rays from the earth beneath it As the States surrounding these lakes are more or less underlaid bylimestone we may suppose the bottoms of the waters are in some placespaved with it and from this or the shores under the water and aroundit may be reflected according to the Count’s theory the light whichgives the water a green appearance But I will not trouble you with anymore speculations they come with an ill grace from me who103 only pretendto describe all that passes before my eyes In the afternoon we were off Saginaw bay an indentation in the coast ofMichigan running seventy or eighty miles deep and forty wide making thelake here very broad in one spot we were out of sight of the land Ariver of the same name flows into the bay upon which abouttwentythree miles from its mouth is a small town A canal is proposedfrom this bay across the state to lake Michigan at Grand or Washtenogriver How shall I convey to you an idea of the loveliness which satupon earth air and water this afternoon Certainly that sunset uponlake Huron is the most beautiful I have ever beheld The vast andfathomless lake bounded by the heavens alone presented an immensecircle ‘calm as a molten lookingglass’—to quote from my favoriteJob—surrounded by a band of fleecy clouds making a frame work ofchased silver Slowly and gracefully sank the orb the white cloudsgently dispersing at his approach and leaving their monarch a free andglorious path As he drew near that chrystal floor all brilliancy fadedfrom the face of the lake save one bright pathway from the sun tous—like the bridge of Giamschid leading from earth to heaven The sunwhich I had always been accustomed to see above was now below me nearthe water on the water under the water A veil of purple is thrownover it and now the sun sleeps on lake Huron The gold and rose whichpainted the western sky have gone Darkness has stolen over the worldbelow and we turn our eyes above What a high and noble dome ofloveliest blue Upon one side there hangs a cres104cent of the purestpearly white while at its side steals forth one silver star soonfollowed as saith Ezekiel by ‘all the bright lights of heaven’ untilnight’s starembroidered drapery is canopied around us What bosom isinsensible to this gorgeous firmament Who hath not felt the ‘sweetinfluence of the Pleiades’ while gazing at this starry roof above Iwish I could make you a piece of poetry upon this subject but as thereis enough already composed upon the stars I will send you a bit ofByron and tell you— Do you remember that little hymn our old nurse used to teach us in ourchildhood Yes from childhood to manhood we wish to penetrate into the mysteriesof those golden regions and ever ask them to tell us ‘what you are’ Wesee them gem the night with their lustrous beauty we watch them as theypace their azure courts and lose ourselves in high imaginings too vastfor us while earth still keeps our souls its prisoner How much deepermust be the interest with which the astrologer of old followed them intheir ‘golden tracks’ In them he read his destiny and thought to seethe scenes of earth reflected in their light How must he have gazedupon them as their rays paled or brightened while reading in them ‘thefate of man and105 empires’ Man’s efforts to penetrate the mysteries ofthese glorious creations have not been all in vain The Almightyarchitect from time to time graciously bestows upon him knowledge of‘parts of his ways’ How much more has been vouchsafed to us than to theearly nations Looking back through the vista of the past we shall seegreat men appear as ‘stars to rule the night’ of our darkness and tellus of creation’s mysteries Solomon Ptolemy Gallileo CopernicusTycho Brahe Paschal Newton Herschel with a host of satellites havebeen graciously shown the book of knowledge to light man’s pathwaythrough the earth and enlarge his ideas of the magnificence and thebenevolence of his Creator ‘In the beginning’ it did not enter intoGod’s purpose to tell mankind more of the starry host than that theywere ‘lights to rule the night’ and for ‘signs and for seasons’ nowsee what amazing things have been shown to us We know they are worldslike our own filled with mountains and seas having night and daysummer and winter We see their fields now white with snow now darkwith returning vegetation How our hearts bound with hopes of futureknowledge and imagine the time will come when we can gaze upon theirlandscapes and ‘listen to the hum of their mighty population’16 Wehave seen nature in all its power and grandeur while tossed on Erie’swaves or listening to the thunder of Niagara but here she is at restin all her quiet loveliness and would her worshippers behold her in herfairest mood let them come and gaze at evening on lake Huron106 July 4th—The sun and I arose at the same time When I left mystateroom as if waiting to greet me it arose majestically from thebosom of the water flooding the lake with light No land was descriedupon the east but we were near the Michigan shore off Thunder bay TheShanewaging islands which stretch across it were distinctly visible andpresented various beauties of shape and tint All trace of man has nowdisappeared for the northern part of Michigan has never been settledowing to the intense cold of the winters We have passed a long line ofcoast without any inhabitant except a forlorn woodman’s hut in onespot stretching for two hundred and fifty miles covered with boundlessforests in whose green recesses there are paths ‘which no fowl knowethand which the vultures eye hath not seen’ Here is the home of the bearthe elk and the moosedeer—and upon the aspen oak and maple treessport the blue bird the robin and yellow hammer undisturbed by thefoot of man We have now past the bounds of civilization and our vesselis the only spot of life in this vast region of forest and water From the entrance of Lake Huron to Mackinac there were but two placeswhere man was visible At the mouth of the Zappa river soon afterentering the lake there is a cabin where a woodman resides in thesummer season to supply the steamboats and at Presque Isle where westopped in the afternoon there is another cluster of cabins andwoodpiles Our Captain did not stop at this latter place as he did notlike their wood it being chiefly swamp ash The shore is low coveredwith trees having below a beach of yellow sand until just beforecoming in sight of107 Michilimackinac when the land becomes a littleelevated Ten miles this side of the last mentioned place we passedBoisblanc a large wooded island taking its name of ‘white wood’ fromthe silver barked birch tree This island belongs to government and itsonly inhabitants save a few straggling Ottowas are the family of thelighthouse keeper whose pretty tenement and stately lighthouseappear upon a projecting point There is also a farm upon the islandgiven by government to the Missionaries of Michilimackinac whosometimes maintain a farmer upon it O Mackinaw thou lonely island howshall I describe thy various beauties certainly for situation historyand native loveliness it is the most interesting island in our StatesWe approach it through an avenue of islands Drummond and Manitoulindimly seen on our east and Boisblanc and Round in our western sideStretching across our path far away in front of us is Mackinawpainted against the clear blue sky The island of Michilimackinac orMackinaw or Mackinac as it is commonly spelt and pronounced is a highand bold bluff of limestone about three hundred feet above the watercovered with verdure Its name signifies in the Indian tongue greatturtle as it is something of the figure of this animal At the foot ofthe bluff are strewed the buildings of the town Among the mostconspicuous of these are the agency house and gardens residence of MrSchoolcraft Indian Agent—and the church and mission house Along thebeach were several Indian wigwams while numerous pretty bark canoeswere going and coming as this is the Indian stopping place A verybeautiful and conspicuous object was the United States fort presentingat a distance108 the appearance of a long white line of buildingsinserted into the top of the island high above the town As weapproached its picturesque blockhouses and the pretty balconiedresidences of the officers came out to view having the banner of the‘stripes and stars’ waving over them While gazing at this fair picturesuddenly a brilliant flame and volumes of white smoke arose above thefort while a booming sound told us they were firing their middaysalute in honor of the day This added much to the beauty and grandeurof the scene As our boat was to remain there for some hours wedisembarked and ascended to the fort to visit our friends the commandingofficer and his family We found them sitting upon their balconylooking down upon the newly arrived steamboat After the first greetingsand mutual enquiries were over we were shown all it was thought wouldinterest us The view from our friend’s balcony was beautiful in the extreme The bayin front the lovely islands around covered with a luxuriousvegetation—the town spread out at our feet—the Indian lodges and thecanoes skimming the bright waters each called forth our expressions ofadmiration Passing into the interior of the fort and through the fineparade ground and a large gateway we found ourselves upon the summit ofthe island Our path lay through copses of white birch maple andvarious other trees and over green sward covered with strawberries anda variety of wild flowers Our friends kindly gathered for me a varietyof these among which was a fine scarlet lilium superbum blue bellsand kinni kanic or Indian tobacco and a pretty plant called Indianstrawberry Suddenly109 the silver tones of woman’s voice sounded nearand in a fairy dell we came upon a tent surrounded by a party of ladiesand gentlemen busily engaged preparing for a fete in honor of the dayAmong them was the daughter of our host and some of the celebratedfamily of S——t We were presented to the party and were quitechagrined our limited time would not permit us to accept theirinvitation to remain and partake of their festivities The grace andbeauty of Mrs S——t made great impression upon us To me she waspeculiarly interesting from the fact of her being descended from thenative lords of the forest for you know I have always taken thegreatest interest in the fate of our Indian tribes From the accent thedeep brunette of her smooth skin and her dark hair and eyes I shouldhave taken her for a Spanish lady From the tent we wound our way up toa high peak of the island When near the summit we left a grove andsaw before us one of the most picturesque and singular objectsimaginable It was a high arched rock of white limestone stretchingacross a chasm before us making a pretty natural bridge through whichwe gazed far down into the waves of Huron at least two hundred feetbelow The surprise the beauty and novelty of this striking objectbrought forth expressions of admiration from us The white arch wasadorned with tufts of wild flowers and shrubbery Ascending the archwe gazed down upon the white beach below whose pebbles could be heredistinctly seen under the limpid water although many feet deep—and outupon the fair waters and the pretty islands which We were obliged to be satisfied with a hasty view of this charmingscene as our time was limited and we turned reluctantly towards ourboat without visiting the ruins of fort Holmes upon the high summit ofthe island While passing through the town we observed several antiquehouses which had been erected by the French who first settled thisplace in sixteen hundred and seventy three These are frail delapidated buildings covered with roofs of bark Uponthe beach a party of Indians had just landed and we stood while theytook down their blanket sail and hauled their birch bark canoe abouttwenty feet long upon the shore These are the Menominies or wild riceeaters the ugliest Indians I had ever seen—also Winebagoes with darkskin low foreheads and shaggy hair and having no pretentions to dressI saw a chief however afterwards who was gaily bedizened with tinselbeads and paint having one side of his face a light pea green and theother cheek scarlet We watched them erect their lodges which was donevery soon—a few poles were placed in a circle one end of each stood inthe earth while the others met at the top—coarse matting was foldedaround these leaving an opening for a door over which a blanket washung Some matting being spread upon the floor inside the children andmoveables were placed inside and the canoe drawn up near it We visitedsome of the shops and laid up a store of Indian articles which are madeby these poor people and sold here Among them were small baskets calledMococks made of birch bark embroidered with porcupine quills staineddifferent colors—this was filled with maple sugar It is pleasant tomeet friends111 so far from home but I think the pleasure is almostcounterbalanced by the pain of parting This we felt keenly when theplanks had withdrawn and our friends had been forced to leave us as wegazed after them winding their way up to the fort the shores andwaters around seemed more desolate more lonely than before Just before the steamboat started we had an opportunity of judging ofthe boasted transparency of this water its depth having prevented thison our voyage I looked down into it from the boat where it was twentyfeet deep and could scarcely believe there was anything but air betweenus and those shining pebbles below We had also an opportunity ofhearing some Indian music Upon the shore sat a group of unearthlybeings one of whom struck several taps upon a sort of drum accompaniedby the others in what sounded like a wolf recitative—at the end ofthis all united in a yell which dyed away over the lake much in thestyle of a howling blast accompanied by the shrieks of a drowningtraveller Our fishing party left us here to go up the Sault St Maryinto lake Superior spending their summer days among the picturesquescenery of that magnificent lake We bade adieu with much regret to thispretty island whose green terraces fort and picturesque town Indianlodges and light canoes made a beautiful scene—but the mostinteresting point in the view was that white handkerchief wavingfarewell from the fortress balcony This island is 615 miles from Buffalo 319 from Detroit There are watermarks upon the rocks 200 feet above the lake proving the water hadonce112 stood so high The scenery here has been prettily described by anauthor of talent Mrs Jameson but as much pleased as I was with herbook I must regret she came here under such circumstances It is withreluctance I censure one so gifted but it is with a view of warningyou and my young friends to whom I know you will show my lettersagainst errors to which the very witchery of her genius would blind youHowever passionate a desire you may entertain for the picturesque Ihope you may never leave the protection of your friends and wander insearch of it alone May your curiosity to see great men never lead youto invade the retreat of a world hating bachelor and may you neverstray in wild forests through storms and tempests with no companionsave a rude Indian or a ‘bronzed brawney unshaven backwoodsman’‘very much like a bear upon his hind legs’ and you ‘a poor lonelyshivering woman’ I quote her words You had better be a ‘tarry at hometraveller’ or write ‘voyages around my own room’ If you do thus youmust expect the ladies where you visit will look ‘formal and alarmed’as she tells us the ladies of Toronto looked upon her But now I havedone scolding and will pursue my journey Upon a green slope of theMichigan shore a pile of ruins were pointed out as the site of old fortMackinac which was taken by Pontiac with a stratagem and afterwardsevery one within were massacred How must those unfortunates have feltupon this desolate shore hundreds of miles away from their country andat the mercy of savages A band of Chippewa’s or Ojibwa’s were justpassing in canoes thirty feet in length This tribe stands higher inrank than the others113 and their language like the French is thepolite tongue among the Indian tribes They have a ruler whose officehas been hereditary for ages He is called Mudjikiwis and they pridethemselves much upon his and their own rank and lineage There is ananecdote related by Schoolcraft of one of this tribe which if youhave never seen will amuse you Chi Waishki alias the Buffalo waspresented by the commissioners of the treaty of Fond du Lac with amedal as a badge of distinction ‘What need have I of this’ he saidhaughtily ‘It is known whence I am descended’ These canoes are theprettiest and lightest things imaginable They are formed of the bark ofthe birch tree sewn together with a thread made from fine roots ofcedar split The bark is soaked to make it more pliable Sometimes theyare very gaily painted and ornamented The paddles are of light woodOur Captain placed before us at dinner a very fine lake trout which hehad purchased at Mackinaw It was two feet long and very deliciousFine salmon are also taken in these lakes We were now upon the greatlake Michigan which stretches from here three hundred and twenty milesto the Illinois shore and is nine hundred feet deep Our course laynear the Michigan shore which presented high bluffs and points oflimestone with banks of pebbles and high jagged hills or dunes ofsand These pebbles and sand are said to be thrown up by thenorthwestern winds but I should rather imagine them left up by thefloods which have swept over the land Upon our right were Fox andBeaver isles beyond which Green bay runs into Wisconsin one hundredand three miles This northern shore of Michi114gan is uninhabited andcovered with dense forests The ledges and masses of white limestoneupon some of these islands looked like fortresses or other buildings July 5th—Sunday upon the lake When I left my cabin I found themorning was misty and the sun looking like the yolk of an egg wasbobbing up and down upon the water It had just peeped above the waveswhich dashing about sometimes obscured it from our view We were lyingat one of the Manitou islands taking in wood This is a pretty crescentshape islet covered with trees In the centre we were told is a lakewhich is unfathomable and supposed to be connected with lake MichiganIt is filled with the large trout salmon and white fish of the lakesThere is a woodman’s hut and several large piles of wood upon theshore ‘Oh that the woodman would spare those trees’ Soon the prettyisland will be denuded and forlorn It is a sacred island—the Indiansimagining it to be the residence of their Manitou never dare to landthere as they believe such an intrusion would be followed by the angerof their Deity One Indian who despised such superstition ventured uponthe shore and was never heard of since The forests and lake in theinterior they imagine is the abode of the blessed after death whosehours will there pass in hunting and fishing The Manitoulin islands inlake Huron are also sacred but they are much larger than these one ofthem being fiftyfive miles in length I secured a handful of pebblesfrom the shore which like those of other lakes are agate chalcedonyand other sileceous minerals Upon the115 shores of lake Superior theseare found very fine mixed with trachte lava and other volcanic rocksand with masses of native copper I had brought with me a package ofwell selected tracks which I opened this morning and laid a few uponthe table of the ladies saloon Soon after a pretty little girl knockedat my stateroom door saying her mother wished to know if I had anymore tracts as she should like to read one I asked her where werethose I laid upon the table those she replied some ladies werereading I gave her several The chambermaid next appeared begging forsome and then the cabin boy came with the same request While I wasselecting one which I thought might suit him I observed a brawny duskyfigure with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his person begrimed withsoot and smoke gazing earnestly towards us ‘That’s Tom one of thefiremen’ said the cabin boy with a snigger ‘he heard you had books tolend and wants one dreadfully’ I beckoned to him and he came forwardwith alacrity while behind him I discerned several other ‘grim visaged’beings peeping out from their compartment towards us I gave him apackage to distribute among his fellows and during the day had thepleasure of observing the greater part of the crew and passengers busilyengaged with my books During our long voyage those who had books hadread them out and those who had none were getting very weary so thatthey eagerly received any thing in the shape of reading But some ofthem I trust read them for the sake of the benefit they hoped toreceive from their contents It was a source of great satisfaction tobehold so many persons engaged in themes of high im116port to their soul’sbest interest These seeds were sown with a prayer for their successand who can tell what immortal plants may spring up in some of theirhearts growing to a tree of life and bearing fruit to flourish in thegarden of paradise Let me urge you never to travel without these orother useful books to distribute on your way—like the girl in the fairytale of our youth shedding gems and treasures in your path There is nolibrary in this boat as upon our Hudson and Eastern steamboats and wewere often amused with the alacrity with which our books were snatchedup when we laid them down for a strole or to look at some object uponthe shores When we returned we were always sure to receive them againand felt no vexation as we knew they meant no impoliteness and wouldbe willing to lend us their own in return My companion had never beenused to such socialisms in his country and was quite amused at thisfree and easy sort of thing Our books were some of them French andupon one occasion we found them in the hands of a simple hearted son ofthe forest to whom books were so rare a treasure he could not resistexamining them He returned it with a smile and said shaking his head‘how you can make any sense out of that I can’t see for I cannot read aword of it’ We lost sight of the Michigan shore at ten o’clock and stretched acrossthe lake towards the Wisconsin coast which we first saw at four o’clockP M thus being nearly all day out of the sight of land This may giveyou an idea of the vastness of these lakes Wisconsin or Ouisconsin orWiskonsan here presents a high bank called ‘red banks’ from thecolor117 of the soil covered with forests and showing no trace of manexcept at the mouth of the river Sheboygan two hundred and twenty milesfrom Mackinaw where is a small settlement called by the name of theriver Fifty miles from Sheboygan we stopped at the town of Milwaukie towardswhich the tide of emigration has been rapidly flowing As the bay iscrossed by a bar our large boat could not enter and a small steamboattook from us much of our merchandise and most of our emigrants We didnot go on shore but contented ourselves with seeing the town from theboat It looked neat with some comfortable dwellings several shopshotel court house c It stands upon the Milwaukie river Itspopulation is 1000 Several railroads and canals are in contemplationfrom this place across the territory as railroads to Winnebago lakefrom Belmont to Dubuque from Belmont to Dodgeville in the minedistrict a canal from Milwaukie to the Black river and another throughthe Fox and Wisconsin to the Mississippi Wisconsin will be soon coveredwith a dense population as it is now a favorite point for emigrationThe soil is very rich from one to ten feet deep the surface undulatingprairie and woodland consisting of 100000 square miles of fertileland The grassy plains make fine pasture lands and the lakes andrivers produce abundance of fish and give great manufacturing powerLakes Superior and Michigan and the river Mississippi surround threesides thus enabling them to send their produce to market Flour ryecorn barley whitefish and many other articles have been exportedthis year Their lead mines are very rich and their valuable forests ofpine trees will be another source of118 wealth These growing to theheight of one hundred and eighty or two hundred feet crown the heightsof the northern region of the country which is mountainous containingseveral waterfalls one of which is two hundred and fifty feet inheight The scenery is very picturesque Madison the capital is apretty thriving town surrounded by four transparent lakes upon theshore of one of which it is situated it sometimes goes by the poeticalappellation of ‘city of the four lakes’ When the roads and canals areformed Wisconsin will soon become a thoroughfare to the Mississippi andthe vast regions beyond and those who have ‘the world before them’cannot make a better choice than this Here we left our Buffalo huntersRacine is a town twentytwo miles below Milwaukie The houses lookednew and were arranged in rows upon the high green bank The courthousewas quite showy having a portico in front with pillars reaching to theroof which was painted red surmounted by a tin cupola It stands atthe mouth of Root river We were now again in sight of Michigan as thelake grows narrower towards the end We have passed completely aroundthis state it being in the shape of a triangle It is destined to be agreat and flourishing State surrounded as it is by the lakes crossedby rivers canals and railroads and covered by a rich soil It is twohundred and eighty miles long by one hundred and eighty and covers40000 square miles It has only been admitted into the Union as a Statein 1837 and now possesses a population of 211705 The country islevel except a table land in the center from which the rivers flow intolakes St Clair Huron and Michigan The remainder is covered withgrassy119 prairie land with transparent lakes and tracts of woodlandHere grows the valuable maple from which they obtain their sugar thewhite birch whose bark is used for making canoes roofing houses oreven when split fine in writing letters by the early settlers the oakthe beech the hickory sassafras and various other valuable trees Itsenergetic inhabitants are busily engaged laying out canals andrailroads to intersect it in every direction as means of conveyingtheir produce to its market One hundred and thirtyone miles ofrailroad has been contracted for but only fortyfour miles finishedfrom Detroit to Ann Arbor Over this 41896 barrels of flour wereconveyed this year to Detroit Three years since the inhabitants of thisstate sent to Ohio for their flour and now they export 125000 barrelsof flour this year Education is not neglected the legislature haveappropriated 1200000 acres of land as a school fund which as theland is rapidly rising will be of great value The celebratedSchoolcraft tells us it was deemed so inaccessible from swamps that in1818 it was not thought fit for the soldiers bounty lands This washowever soon discovered to be a mistake He further informs us thesoil is an argillaceous soil mellowed with sands and pebbles underlaidwith schistose and calcareous rocks clothed with an open growth of oaksand hickories the ridges covered with walnut ash beech and maplewhile the valleys are first rate corn land diversified with limpidlakes grassy prairies and pebbly bottomed brooks July 6th—When approaching Chicago the ‘haven where we would be’ Idid not so much watch for the120 appearance of that famed town as lookback with regret at the beautiful lake I was leaving for I was wellassured ‘I ne’er should look upon its like again’ Two days and twonights I had been sailing over it never tired of gazing at its variedshores or beauteous waters Those who have never beheld these masses ofpellucid brilliant green waters can never imagine the extraordinaryloveliness of the scene They cover a surface of 150000 square milesand contain nearly half the fresh water upon the surface of the globeThat the water is fresh is of great importance to those who dwell upontheir shores as it can be of more use for household purposes andmachinery The valley in which the lakes repose is said to have beenhewed out by the deluge leaving the deep chasms in which the waterslie this is called the valley of the St Lawrence and very properlybut I must object to this immense chain of lakes four and five hundredmiles long and nine hundred deep being called the ‘river StLawrence’ as some fashionable tourists have of late The St Lawrenceriver is an outlet but is no more entitled to this designation than isNiagara or St Clair river These lakes all lie in a valley whichinterposes between the primitive and secondary formations The northernshores are granite rocks sterile and scarcely inhabited while thesouthern is rich alluvion covering sandstone and limestone The bustle of arrival aroused me from these reflections and we weresoon seated in the parlor of the Lake Hotel in the famous state ofIllinois and town of Chicago The rapid growth of this place you haveheard of in 1833 it could only count three frame121 dwellings and twohundred and fifty inhabitants and now enumerates six churches onehundred shops several hotels dwelling houses and warehouses andbetween six and seven thousand inhabitants Chicago or Tshicawgo asthe inhabitants and Indians call it is divided by a river of the samename into two parts between which is a free ferry and a bridge Theshops are upon one side and the dwellings upon the other These lastare in the style of country residences enclosed with white palingssurrounded by piazzas and gardens some of brick but many of wood andneatly painted Every thing looks quite new as indeed it might forwhere now the town stands was as late as 1833 a fort before whichwas encamped seven thousand Indians Fort Dearborn was erected for thepurpose of protecting the frontier It was attacked in 1812 by theIndian tribes and their allies and those who escaped massacre soughtprotection in fort Wayne Another fort was built in 1818 but is nowdeserted and let out for tenements There are houses of worship here forseveral denominations among them the Presbyterian church is mostconspicuous It is of brick and neatly finished Part of the moneyrequired for its erection was acquired by the ladies in a Fair TheLake House is a very good hotel situated among the dwelling houses Itis built of brick painted white which with its green blinds gives ita pleasant appearance every thing within was comfortable and good ofits kind According to our usual practice we ascended to the cupola ofthe hotel where is a lovely view of the cottages and gardens at ourfeet the broad prairies beyond and the bright waters of Michiganbehind us This town122 is beautifully situated upon the borders of thelake through which it holds constant communication with Buffalo and theeast The other route I mentioned from Detroit continues over therailroad at that city and by cross roads to St Joseph’s upon thelake from which place steamboats are continually plying to Chicago Itis a shorter road and gives the traveller a view of the interior ofMichigan The Illinois and Michigan canal commences here which is to becarried to Peru on the Illinois river a distance of one hundred milesthus opening a communication with the Mississippi and the Gulf ofMexico It is six feet deep and sixty feet wide and is nearly finishedThe climate here is variable In the summer the wind will one day blowover the surface of the prairies and the weather will become very hotbut the next day perhaps it will come from the lake and cool it againIn consequence of the vicinity of the lake there is not much snow andit is not very cold We spent here one day only but were able to see every thing in andabout the town and in conversation with those friends residing hereobtained every information We intended making a longer stay butlearned that the regular line of stages left town that evening whichobliged us to go on or to stay longer than our time would admit Beforereaching here it was our intention to go to Michigan City which is inIndiana upon the shores of the lake and from thence cross Indiana toMadison upon the Ohio through a fine succession of rail andMacadamized roads Our friends here however seemed to think it somonstrous a thing to return without beholding the celebratedMississippi when within a few hundred miles123 only that we determinedto alter our course and go down the Illinois river At nine o’clock at night we entered a commodious stage drawn by fourgood horses which was to take us to Peoria upon the Illinois onehundred and fiftyseven miles distant for which we were to paytwentytwo dollars eleven each bed and board included Beside us weretwo other passengers Crossing the bridge we took up the mail at thepost office and then drove through a long range of cheerfully lightedshops until we found ourselves out of town Here the road crossed thewet prairie as it is called which in some seasons when the lake ishigh is overflown Through this wet land we went splash splash nearlyhalf the night A railroad is proposed here which will rendertravelling more pleasant Hour after hour passed away my companions alldozing while I sought sleep in vain The vast plain over which we weremoving seen through the dusk of a cloudy night seemed a fitting placefor dark deeds—a fine Hounslow heath or Indian lurking place Butthere are no bandits here and the Indians were all over theMississippi and I was bidding such idle fears avaunt when suddenly alow plaintive wail sounded over the waste startling my companions fromtheir slumbers ‘What was that unearthly cry’ I asked ‘Only a prairiewolf madam’ ‘Dear me’ exclaimed the other passenger a youth ‘I hopethere are not many of them for sometimes wolves attack horses’ ‘Not inthese prairies sir’ replied the other passenger ‘they are rather shyand afraid of us’ ‘I am glad at least to see a light’ returned theyouth ‘there must be a house yonder’ ‘Yes a bower in the rushesnothing else’ replied the124 other man ‘If you follow that light it willlead you a pretty chase through the marshes it is a jacko’lantern’The hour seen by the light of the coach lamp proved to be twelve andeach settled in his corner for another doze A sudden halt of the stageawakened us The coachman took down a lamp and began to search forsomething on the ground ‘Halo driver what have you lost’ asked theyouth ‘Only my road sir’ he replied ‘Lost your road’ exclaimed theyouth in dismay ‘Lost in these lonely moors among wolverines andjacko’lanterns Here’s a pretty fix’ ‘Driver you ought to keep theskin off your eyes in such a dark night I guess’ said the otherpassenger I only wondered he could ever keep his road as there was nohouse or tree to mark his course even in the day and one might easilypass over the worn pathway in these grassy plains The driver soonresumed his seat having discovered his path and gave us the agreeableintelligence he had gone three miles out of his way A few hours afterthis a huge body suddenly appeared before the window—it turned out tobe a tree a sign we were approaching a river Soon after we foundourselves before the door of a small house upon the banks of a narrowbut deep and placid stream fringed with trees This was the Des Plainesa river which rises so near lake Michigan that in times of itsoverflow boats have passed from one to another This interlocking ofwaters which flow different ways Darby considers ‘an astonishinghydrographical anomaly’ All the waters we had passed have fallen intothe Atlantic while those we were now following find their way into thegulf of Mexico The Des Plaines is called a branch of the125 Illinoiswhich joins with the Kankakee and afterwards the Fox and the unitedstreams take the name of the Illinois Many modern writers consider thisas the Illinois and drop the name of Des Plaines which I should judgea proper arrangement We awakened the drowsy owner of the houseprocured some refreshment and with fresh horses resumed our journey July 7th—I fell asleep and when I was awakened at dawn thismorning by my companion that I might not lose the scene I startedwith surprise and delight I was in the midst of a prairie A world ofgrass and flowers stretched around me rising and falling in gentleundulations as if an enchanter had struck the ocean swell and it wasat rest forever Acres of wild flowers of every hue glowed around meand the sun arising from the earth where it touched the horizon was‘kissing with golden face the meadows green’ What a new and wonderousworld of beauty What a magnificent sight Those glorious ranks offlowers Oh that you could have ‘one glance at their array’ How shall Iconvey to you an idea of a prairie I despair for never yet hath penbrought the scene before my mind Imagine yourself in the centre of animmense circle of velvet herbage the sky for its boundary upon everyside the whole clothed with a radiant efflorescence of every brillianthue We rode thus through a perfect wilderness of sweets sending forthperfume and animated with myriads of glittering birds andbutterflies— It was in fact a vast garden over whose perfumed paths covered withsoil as hard as gravel our carriage rolled through the whole of thatsummer day You will scarcely credit the profusion of flowers upon theseprairies We passed whole acres of blossoms all bearing one hue aspurple perhaps or masses of yellow or rose and then again a carpet ofevery color intermixed or narrow bands as if a rainbow had fallen uponthe verdant slopes When the sun flooded this Mosaic floor with lightand the summer breeze stirred among their leaves the irredescent glowwas beautiful and wonderous beyond any thing I had ever conceived Ithink this must have been the place where Armida planted her garden forshe surely could not have chosen a fairer spot Here are The gentle undulating surface of these prairies prevent sameness andadd variety to its lights and shades Occasionally when a swell israther higher than the rest it gives you an extended view over thecountry and you may mark a dark green waving line of trees near thedistant horizon which are shading some gentle stream from the sun’sabsorbing rays and thus ‘Betraying the secret of their silent course’Oak openings also occur green groves arranged with the regularity ofart making shady alleys for the heated traveller What a tenderbenevolent Father have we to form for us so bright a world How filledwith glory and beauty must that mind have been who conceived so muchloveliness If for his erring children he has created so fair a dwellingplace how well127 adorned with every goodly show must be the celestialhome reserved for his obedient people Eye hath not seen it—ear hathnot heard it—nor can it enter into our hearts to conceive it I observe in all fashionable tours what is eaten and drank seems to bematter of immense importance and perhaps you will be disappointed if Ido not touch upon themes of such high import We had been warned ourfare upon these ‘lonesome prairies’ would be poor and of course we didnot expect the tables of a New York hotel The scarcity of stone and ofwood—as there are no pine and cedar except in the northern parts ofWisconsin—forbids much elegance in the few houses scattered along theroad and the first post house at which we stopped for breakfast was arude log cabin Our detention during the night had prevented ourarriving at the usual breakfast hour and it was supposed we had takenour meal elsewhere and of course we were obliged to wait ‘BreakfastBreakfast’ was the cry of driver and passengers as we alighted ‘Ayeaye’ returned the landlord—‘I will scare you up as good a feed as youcould find in Chicago’ The room we entered was plainly furnished but Iremarked a pile of books upon a bureau among which were the life ofGen Harrison—Rollins Ancient History—Vicar of Wakefield and severalreligious works I regretted I could only place a few tracts among themWhen I travel again in such lonely parts I will endeavor to find acorner in my trunks for a few good books to leave among this readingpeo128ple The mistress and her daughter were very busy scaring up ourbreakfast of which I should think the chickens were the most scaredThey soon placed upon the table cloth some fine smoking potatoes fromtheir garden—nice indian meal cakes eggs milk cheese cucumbersbutter bread and ‘chicken fixens’ Every thing being native producewas very nice but the coffee being a foreign article was not as goodas I have seen before I must confess The landlady’s method ofpreparing it was so novel that I will write off the recipe for youredification I had retreated to the kitchen fire as I slept rathercold last night it being misty and there observed her process Sheplaced some coffee grains in an iron pot which being scared about alittle until somewhat brownish were laid upon the kitchen table andpounded with a rolling pin Boiling water being poured upon it thecoffee was dished up Every one drank it contentedly and I beingthirsty drank it also The driver who sat next to me having lived muchin Chicago and other refined places rather turned up his nose saying itwas not half as good as he got at the Lake House My companion contentedhimself with milk While waiting at the door for the stage our hosts’son galloped up dismounted and tied his horse to the fence The animallooked as untamed as if just caught his wild bright eyes flashed frombeneath his shaggy uncut mane and he pawed the ground snorted andstruggled as if determined to break away and scour the free plainsagain ‘Your horse loves not restraint’ said I ‘he wishes to be free’‘Aye aye the critter snuffs a wolf and wants to be after him’ ‘Awolf’ ‘Yes—he is my wolf hunter and dearly does he love129 a chaseafter them When he sees them nothing can stop him from chasingthem—but they give him a pretty tough run sometimes I have seen himfollow one for a mile ere he overtook him and then with one stroke ofhis foot the wolf is dead’ I am sure the horse understood hismaster—his eye was fixed upon us while he spoke and when he endedtost his mane with a triumphant expression and stamped fiercely upon theground as if his enemy were beneath his foot ‘All aboard’ cries the driver and we were again upon our course ourhorses prancing gaily as if refreshed by their breakfast A treeappeared against the horizon looking exactly like a sail in thedistance—others followed it and soon beautiful groups of forest treeswere sprinkled over the prairie in front This was a token of thevicinity of water and in a short time we found ourselves upon anelevated bank from which we looked down upon a verdant valley throughthe centre of which ran a silver stream This was the valley of the DesPlaines—having every appearance of being the bed of a broad and deepriver Many geologists among them Prof Sheppard thinks this and thevalley of the Illinois have been scooped out by a vast torrent pouringfrom lake Michigan Upon the opposite shore of the river and in thisvale at the foot of the ancient bank stands the pretty town of Jolietimproperly spelt Juliet The whole scene was one of great beauty Wedescended the bank which is nearly one hundred feet high and iscomposed of yellow waterworn pebbles Winding down the road upon thehigh bank opposite was a long train of covered waggons filled with ahousehold upon its way to130 ‘a new home’ upon the prairies After fordingthe stream now rendered shallow by the summer heats passing over thegreen sward we found ourselves before the door of the principal hotel inthe town Joliet takes its name from the old French traveller fatherJoliet who came here as a missionary in 1673 and stands at the mouthof a little stream of the same name This is growing into a place ofsome importance as the Michigan canal crosses the river here and alltravellers to the Illinois pass through it It has a fine water powerfor the descent of this river to the rapids at Ottowa is great—thelockage of the canal being 142 feet The population is over 600 Thereis here a court house houses of worship mills taverns and severalshops We remained here only long enough to change horses Whilestanding upon the steps the covered waggons arrived from which lookedforth men women children dogs and cats while pots and kettles andchairs were dangling below A group of sturdy looking men stood aroundthe door After our American fashion of asking questions I addressedone of them who stood near me and asked from what country he hadtravelled ‘From St Thomas in Canada ma’am’ he replied ‘We are sixtyfamilies’ said another ‘and have left there because we want morefreedom We would live where we can say what we choose and do what wechoose There our tongues are fettered’ I learnt they were going toRock river a very fashionable place of emigration now This is abeautiful stream running through the north west part of Illinois intothe Mississippi The land is prairie upon its borders which will wellrepay the agriculturist’s labors while131 its rapids place a great amountof manufacturing power at the disposal of the settlers The lead regionis also in its vicinity At the mouth of Rock river in the Mississippiis a pretty island of limestone three miles long which is occupied byfort Armstrong garrisoned by United States troops Dixonville on thisriver is a growing town This I learned from my emigrants andafterwards saw confirmed in a Gazetteer So you see what a nice plan itis while travelling to extract information from all you meet I am neverbashful at asking I bade adieu to the emigrants hoping they would havetheir full of chat from which it seems they were debarred and let theprairies ‘prate of their whereabouts’ We recrossed the river where wefound the newer part of Joliet built in a solid manner of the yellowlimestone which is quarried here The sides of the canal and viaductwere also formed of this pretty stone which gives quite a gay look tothe place It is said by Professor Shephard to be magnesian limestonewhich occurs also at Chicago abounding in orthrocera turboterebratula caryophillia c and extends he thinks through the lakesIt is taken out here in stratified layers and at Chicago where it hasa slaty structure it is used for flagging A few miles from Joliet wepassed an object to me of the greatest interest—it was an Indianmound This was a perfect gem—as regular as smooth and as green as ifcut out of an emerald—being an oblong of fifty rods high and seventyor eighty long Although centuries have passed since it was formed itis as perfect in shape as if just moulded A beautiful solitary thingit is telling of nations and events now lost in the mists of time We132saw afterwards several others bearing upon their summits ancient oaksplain indication of their great antiquity Flowers again in untoldnumbers were covering the prairies and here are many of our gardenflowers growing wild as blue bells flox bouncing bet sweet williamroses cocoris beliotrope astre c beside wild flowers as fringedgentean solidago orchis yellow golden rod scarlet lilly wildindigo superb pink moccasin flower and scarlet lobelia There weremany I had never seen—among them was a species of teazle having a tallstem purple head surrounded by a fringe of long pink leaves—I calledit the Indian fairy for as its dark head bobbed about and its pinkmantle flowed around it it looked like a tiny Indian In fact flowers were smiling and blooming in every direction What a nice place for somehortuculturist to transport himself and cottage Rural Howett wouldenjoy the scene—and Miller who loves to ‘babble o’ green fields’ andflowers would find fitting subject here for his blossoming pen I welcome every flower I see with tender pleasure as if the gift of afriend—for I know they were planted among us to add to our enjoymentTheir culture has soothed many a mourning heart and their blossoming isas eagerly looked for in the spring as if their own loved one wasreturning from the earth There is nothing that can so soon transport usto scenes and friends long gone and awaken buried memories of formerjoy as these brilliant creations Earth would look dim without them—thebride would133 want a grace—the bier would seem more gloomy—while thesculptor the artist and the embroiderer would lose their prettiestmodel of adornment A line of trees proclaimed a river near and we soon dashed through theAu Sable the horses dancing with joy as the clear cool waters curledabout their feet The sight of a house upon the opposite bank seemedquite a novelty as we had not seen one since leaving Joliet at nineo’clock and it was now one The house was of boards painted white anda hanging sign proclaimed it one of entertainment Here we dined andchanged horses The meats were very good the pies and custardstolerable but the vegetables were the finest we had ever tasted Peasbeans potatoes all were very excellent Every thing we saw was from thelandlords farm which extended over the prairie some distance from hishouse He and his men came in from the corn fields when the conchsounded for dinner and without their coats—their shirt sleeves rolledup they placed themselves beside us—one does not dress for dinner uponthe prairies While travelling in unsettled countries one must leave allone’s nicities at home It took us some little time to shut our eyesagainst soiled table covers iron knives and forks c—but onceresolved to overlook it we succeeded and ceased to notice it When weconsider what a life these early settlers have led we should onlywonder things are as decent as they are The man comes out here in hisyouth with an axe upon his shoulder—hews him a space in the forestand erects a log hut—here upon the floor spread with the skin of abeast perhaps he sleeps his only companions his dog or an Indian—hegradually acquires134 furniture of his own making and when he came toeating from a table instead of a stone or a stump he thinks himselfvery comfortable A table cloth is such a luxury that he scarcelyremarks when it gets soiled as even then it is cleaner than his logtable and knives of the coarsest description are treasures to him Ourlandlord spoke of his prairie land with the greatest enthusiasm Theground is very hard to break generally requiring several yoke of oxenwhile beneath that the mould is several feet in thickness withoutstones requiring no manuring and apparently inexhaustible Some of theold settlements where farms had been worked for twelve years it wasstill as fertile as ever—giving the tiller very little trouble andyielding rich crops The oasis or ‘oak openings’ upon the prairies arevery beautiful We passed through one this morning It presented theappearance of a lawn or park around some gentleman’s seat The treesare generally oak arranged in pretty clumps or clusters upon the smoothgrass—or in long avenues as if planted thus by man From their limbshang pretty vines as the pea vine—lonicera flava honeysuckle—andwhite convolvulus While our carriage wound among these clumps orthrough the avenues it was almost impossible to dispel the illusionthat we were not driving through the domain of some rich proprietor andwe almost expected to draw up before the door of some lordly mansionOur afternoon drive from the Au Sable to Ottowa was through a treelessprairie looking very much like a vast lake or ocean So much is thisappearance acknowledged by the country people that they call the stagecoach a prairie schooner When135 the sun shines brightly over thelandscape its yellow light gives the prairie an azure hue so that onecan scarcely see where the earth ends and the sky begins Theundulations are a very singular feature in the landscape This is bestseen at early morning or sunset light—the summit of every little swellis illumined while the hollow between lies in shadow thus making theground a curious chequer work We saw many prairie hens or species ofgrouse this afternoon but no wolves or deer much to my regret Theroad is so much travelled that they avoid it and retire to moresequestered places Birds innumerable were sporting in the sun’s lightamong the flowers and butterflies clad like Miltons angels in ‘purplebeams and azure wings that up they fly so drest’ And now you ask to what is the prairie land owing fire or water Manyare the theories upon this subject The Indian name for prairie isscutay fire and they are in the custom of burning off the grassevery fall Some will tell you to this must be traced the dearth oftrees As the mould is so deep—in some places twenty feet and thereare in it except in one or two places no trace of trees or the hugestumps they leave this does not seem probable at least the trees musthave been burnt from ages Others will tell you it is the sediment of anocean which is spread over the land—or in some places large lakes InIllinois it is said there was once as large a lake as Michigan whichburst its barrier at the grand tower rocks upon the Mississippi A chainof lakes it is said have once stood upon the western land which haveleft these basins of deep alluvion covered with herbage These watertheorists one of whom is Schoolcraft136 point to the bowlder’s ofgranite and gneiss which are scattered over the country from thenorthern ocean to the gulf of Mexico lost rocks as they are called astraces of this flood Why not join the two theories The land has nodoubt been covered with water this is proved by the ‘lost rocks’ bythe hard packed soil like the bottom of a lake by its inky blacknesswhen wet as we see in marshes and by the marsh grasses and waterplants which are seen growing upon it This land when dry was occupiedby the Indians who kindled a fire at the edges of a circle among therushes which drove the animals in the centre where they were caughtThe roots of the prairie grass is not destroyed by fire and ittherefore could not so completely eradicate the roots of those enormoustrees which grow upon the western land There is nothing in a prairieland to prevent the growth of trees as wherever the fire is checkedthey immediately spring up The rivers also protect their trees fromfire Prairie land occupies two thirds of the State of Illinois the dearth ofwater and wood and stone will prevent them from being settled verythickly except in the vicinity of the rivers so that these beautifulplains will long remain undisturbed to gratify the traveller’s eye Theprairies would of course be underlain with coal as this great mass ofvegetation which has been destroyed by the floods which have stood uponthem pressed beneath the incumbent strata and exposed to heatmoisture and pressure will produce fermentation and afterwardshardened strata accordingly it is found that coal is universal everywhere in the west Why should we stop at137 second causes in consideringthe origin of prairies why speak of Indian fires or rushing floodsThe Almighty mind who hath conceived this admirable globe and who withsuch infinite taste hath formed and beautified it decking it withflowers and every other delight has spread out this fair western worldwith lakes immense and stately forests wondrous cataracts smilingprairies and broad rolling rivers to decorate the abode of His lovedalthough erring sons He in his wisdom foresaw the time would comewhen the exhausted soil and crumbling institutions and crowded homesof the old world would require a new field for its overgrownpopulation and held this world perdu beneath the ocean caves until thefitting moment When the hour had come it arose fresh and blossomingfrom the sea adorned with a goodly variety of mountain lake fairplain and noble river to compensate the lonely wanderer for the homehe has been forced to leave Now is not that a pretty theory That thiscontinent was much longer submerged beneath the diluvial flood and isindeed a new world is I believe generally conceded by geologistsThere is something delightful to look upon the earth as we do here inits pristine glory and virgin freshness The waters may have lingeredlonger upon the broad valley which lies between the Alleghany and Rockymountains depositing that rich alluvion which lies so deep upon theland and when departing ploughed its way through those great valleyswhere now the western rivers flow It was then perhaps before thedeluge the abode of that monstrous saurian race some sixty feet inlength whose bones are now dug up in Texas and138 must be under thesoil When their ‘days were fulfilled’ they were destroyed and sankbeneath the floods to harden in the limestone and when the land hadbecome dry the mastodon arose and stalked over the western plains forsince he has been discovered buried in the soil of Missouri with Indianarrows sticking in his flesh he is proved not to be antediluvial Whenhis career was over the Indian tribes were admitted into the new bornworld and whatever interest we may take in their fate—however we maypity them we must all agree they have misused their gift Their talentwas hid the fields were untilled the stores of marbles and metalsand materials choice and rare which were placed there that man mightrear him a comfortable habitation and lordly temples for his Godremained unknown in their secret deposites The Indian was doomed toshare the fate of the mammoth the barrier which concealed this worldfrom the older part was loosed and the waves of human population thatrolled over it has pushed back the Indians step by step and thinnedtheir ranks and will thin them until their race also lies under thesoil whose riches they knew not how to use It is a singular and interesting thing to stand as I do now upon theconfines of the earth as it were ‘at the green earth’s end’ and gazeback through the vista of time over Europe and Africa and Asia uponthe nations that have risen and flourished and become extinct each inits turn like those animal races whose story is sculptured geologiststell us upon the ribs and arches of the earth beneath us There we lookupon the decline and fall of nations—here upon their blossomingspringtime And it is a curious139 thing to look on here and see themachinery of world making at work—to behold the progress of societygoing on under your eyes from its infancy to its maturity As in apanorama we behold the wigwam of the savage pass away to give place to alog hut that disappears and a goodly farm appears then a settlement avillage a town in succession until at last an imposing city filledwith institutions for all arts and sciences with temples academiesand all appliances of society in its state of culture and maturityWhile thus watching nations rising and setting moved and transportedupon the earth’s surface as the pieces of a chessboard a guiding handis as distinctly visible as upon the walls of Beltshazzer’s palace Tothe poor Indian the handwriting again appears ‘thou art weighed in thebalance and found wanting’ Beware ye who have inherited his land thatthe sentence be not written up against you also A ground swell rather higher than the rest placed us upon anelevation from whence we looked down upon the enchanting vale ofOttowa A verdant plain lay below us over which two bright rivers werewinding the Fox and the Des Plaines which meeting formed a broad andnoble stream which runs 220 miles from this spot to the MississippiThe Illinois first takes that name here The plain was bounded in thedistance by groves of stately trees and by the bluffs of the IllinoisIn the centre of this fair valley just where the ‘bright waters meet’is the little town of Ottowa It is youngling just come out andcontains only 1006 inhabitants but is rapidly increasing A gentledescent of about a mile brought us to the banks of the Fox beneath theshadow of the shrub140bery which fringed its shores we drove some timefollowing its windings and gazing at the bright sheen of its watersglittering through the foliage We forded it twice while crossing thevalley and so pure and transparent was the stream that the pebbleswhich lay upon the sandstone floor could be seen as distinctly as inthe hand The canal passes here and the workmen were building ahandsome viaduct across the stream The Fox river is here about 100yards wide but is low at this season It rises in Wisconsin and isnavigable to within fifteen miles of lake Michigan near Milwaukie Manyparts of its shore are richly wooded The rapids upon the stream afforda great amount of water power serviceable for machinery A short driveafter again crossing the Fox brought us before the door of theprincipal hotel called the Mansion House The site of Ottowa onlyhaving been laid out in 1830 ten years since you cannot expect manydetails of its fine streets and churches I leave that for the nextyear’s tourist The buildings principally consist of shops arranged ina square upon one side of which is our hotel and upon another side alarge brick courthouse is in progress—this being a county town TheOttawans are much disappointed that the canal did not terminate at theirtown instead of Peru fifteen miles lower down the IllinoisNotwithstanding this the town must increase and enjoys considerabletrade as it is surrounded by a good farming country prairie andwoodland with abundance of limestone and sandstone in its vicinity Itswater power will in time render it another Rochester for the Genesseefarmers who will soon be raising their grain in the plains aroundBe141side this it is the centre of an extensive coal basin which cropsout in various places in the neighborhood Chicago now receives suppliesof that article here which she once obtained from Ohio When theIllinois is high steamboats from St Louis reach here but at presentthey ascend no higher than Peru They gave us a very nice supper herewhich we partook in company with the boarders travellers and ourdriver This last attacked the ham and broiled chickens right manfullydeclaring he was as hungry as a prairie wolf Pray do not expect a billof fare at every place—suffice every thing was as good as could beexpected—nay better for who would look for such city dainties asorange sweetmeats and iced cakes in this young wilderness settlementEvery thing desirable can be obtained by the steamboats here exceptgood cooking and style at table—these will come in time and theirabsence affords variety in our wanderings A peep at the ‘Ottowa Republican’ and several neighboring papersamused us until the stage horn sounded—we entered our stage—theleaders were touched and we bade adieu to Ottowa I fear forever Ishall not soon forget that lovely purple evening which threw such acharm over the scenery as we drove from Ottowa to Peru a distance offifteen miles Our road lay beside the bright Illinois upon prairie orbottom land which lines each side of the river throughout its wholelength making a valley from one to five miles broad skirted with highlimestone and sandstone bluffs The ground was gay with flowers and asthe twilight threw its purple haze over the opposite shore it becamealive with hundreds of brilliant fire flies larger and more luminousthan any I142 had ever seen Many a time have you and I sat in our earlydays upon the banks of the Passaic watching these brilliant creaturesas they starred the black robe of night but we never beheld them solarge and dazzling as these western lights The river was as smooth asa mirror upon which was reflected the trees and rocks with perfectdistinctness but it had a darker hue than those bright waters we hadpassed being tinted with a brownish topaz I remarked this to mycompanion who attributed its dark shade to the alluvion and black mouldthrough which it flowed ‘It cannot be wholesome’ I said ‘I should notlike to drink it’ ‘I guess if you had been on top of that rock threehundred years ago’ said an old man who sat opposite me peering out thestage at the opposite bluffs ‘you’d been glad to drink it ever so muddyor unhealthy’ I opened my eyes and stared enquiringly at him ‘That’sthe rock where the Ingins were starved to death’ he said in answer tomy look ‘Indeed’ I exclaimed ‘Is that starved rock’ Our heads wereout the window and we looked with much interest upon the scene of thatIndian tragedy A high cliff of alternate sandstone and limestonelayers stands out like a turret from the rocky bluffs one hundred andforty feet above the river—it was spotted with moss and fringed withtrees which the sun’s last rays had tinged with gold and amber androse ‘Yes ma’am that’s the rock’ continued our fellow traveller‘Down to the river they sunk their kettles with bark ropes in hopes ofgetting water but the cruel Pottawattamies cut the strings and so theydied’ And so they died What images of anguish sorrow rage anddespair does that short sentence convey to our minds143 The fate of the unhappy band of Illini who dwelt in the fair land whichhas taken their name has been related by Schoolcraft and Flint but asI think you have not seen their works I will tell it you The Illiniwere defeated in battle by the Pottowattamies and retreated to the topof this rock which by a narrow ledge joins the land This spot theydefended some time but at length their provisions and water failedThey scorned to surrender but one by one lay down in dignifiedcomposure and like Cæsar drawing their mantles over them died insilence The last one who had defended the rock at length expired andthe enemy seeing no one appear entered the stronghold to find them allat rest Their bones repose there now The rock is passed and upon theprairie at our right we behold the brazen glare of a fire lighting up adozen dark figures which are flitting around it This is an emigrantbivouac Some of their wagons taken from their wheels shelter the centerwhere the men repose the women and children remain in the othervehicles A fire in the midst keeps off the moschetoes and perhaps aprairie wolf thus affording under the mild sky a comfortable place ofrepose without the expense of a hotel The prairie grass forms a softbed for the men and food for the cattle ‘I reckon the Ottowa folks are pretty considerably nettled’ said ourold traveller in a voice which rendered ‘night hideous’ with itsharshness ‘They thought the canal would end there and they would gitall the trade’ ‘The Ottowa folks don’t depend on no canals I guess’replied another passenger apparently a neighboring farmer taking upthe cudgels for his144 favorite town ‘Ottawa’s a great and increasingplace which will beat Chicorgo yet Wait a while and you’ll see rowsof factories and mills upon the Fox and you’ll see the rapids scoopedout below so that the steamboats can come up at all times and then Iwouldn’t give a cent for your Peru Ottawa folks keep their eyes skinnedI tell you’ ‘Oh you prairie chickens crow loud you are always layingout for mills to grind the grain what you mean to raise You’d bettercome and open a shop now or a bank at Peru things will rise when oldTippecanoe comes to the white house’ ‘Tip me none of your old gineralsif you please’ said his opponent ‘Van’s the man for me Give me VanBuren for President and things will rise enough’ The gurgling of wateras we forded the Little Vermillion drowned the noise of these villagepoliticians much to my comfort Soon after we found ourselves in themidst of a group of Irish shantees occupied by the canal laborersflanked by a row of low wooden tenements upon the bank of themoonillumined Illinois ‘This ladies and gentlemen’ said the farmerin a tone of derision ‘is the grand town of Peru’ ‘Yes and biggerthan Ottawa was when it was as newly settled as Peru’ answered thePeruvian disdainfully As I looked around me I thought of Tinkervilleand its public square in the forest but every thing must have abeginning The steamboat frontier was waiting to receive us and we weresoon with our luggage translated to her deck Fatigued as we were wecould not leave the deck for some time for the night sun as theIndians call the moon was shining brightly down upon the smooth surfaceof the Illinois lighting up her forest glades as we145 passed andthrowing fantastic shadows over the silver water However a night and aday in a stage coach has beaten all romance out of us and we at lengthretreated to our snug stateroom The mosquitoe nets were drawn over usand we soon bid to nature and to you a fair goodnight146 Peoria July 8th My dear E—We were detained during the night by a heavy fog andinstead of reaching Peoria at six found at breakfast we were many milesthis side of it Breakfast over I have seated myself upon the guards asort of balcony which runs around the outside of the steamboat and withnotebook in hand am prepared to give you a faithful picture of all Isee The river is still and bright reflecting every little twig andleaf There is no villa or ruins or lordly mansion to embellish thescenery but it is indebted to its wild forests alone for itsloveliness It flows and bends in a very graceful manner around the softgreen islets or low points fringed with trees of new and unknown formand beauty Frowning above the trees in the back ground are the cliffswaterworn as if once the river’s ancient bound Occasionally our tracklay close to the shore and we gazed into the forest’s deep recessesnow a dark jungle is before us haunt of the wolf and the panther andagain a147 noble grove of witch elms or long vistas through which theearly morning sun was streaming or a patch of brilliant smooth swardsurrounded by a circle of trees the papaw or the silvery barked whitemaple its bright green leaves turning up their silver lining to thebreeze Sometimes a little bay appeared between two promontoriescovered with yellow and white water lillies and the perfumed nympheaodorata the home of the swan or the wild fowl The willow here occursfrequently dipping its leaves in the stream sometimes the shiningwillow with its long and slender brilliant leaves The locust isfrequent many varieties of oak the red bud cotton wood and manyother trees festooned with vines of every tint and variety I wished much to see a prairie wolf and looked out eagerly among theforests in vain Just now a man who was looking to the shore exclaimed‘There’s a wolf’ he pointed to the spot where some dark animal wascowering under a log My companion declared it was a pig and some oneelse a dog whatever it was it soon run away into the forest Ideclared it should be a wolf and to please me it was unanimously voteda prairie wolf A deer I looked for in vain the noise made by ourpuffing high pressure engine being sufficient to scare every animalaway from our path We passed Hennepin during the night and thismorning Lacon and Rome both small places situated upon those elevatedbanks or plateaus which alternate with the woodlands along the riverThe two first are both in Putman county containing two hundred andfiftytwo square miles and a population of two thousand one hundredand148 thirtyone The stream which had become narrower about a quarterof a mile in width now swelled out in an expanse two miles broad andtwenty long called Peoria lake by the indians Pinatawee It aboundswith fish we were told as sturgeon buffalo perch pickerel and catfish and the alligator garr seven feet long covered with scales theformer we had often seen during the morning spring from the water andplunge back again leaving a silvery circle growing wider and wider uponthe polished surface of the river The water was now unruffled by aripple the shore at our left covered with forests throwing theirshadows over the water while upon a high bank at our right was thepretty town of Peoria It was a very sweet and tranquil picture Thishas ever been a favorite haunt of the Indians and French In 1779 avillage stood here called La Ville de Maillet inhabited by Frenchcourier des bois Indian hunters and fur traders a stopping place forthe French upon the lakes and their settlements on the MississippiSubsequently Fort Clarke was erected here for the United States troopsand now a pretty town with six houses of worship several acadamiesmarket houses shops hotels breweries mills and dwellings and ahandsome courthouse with pillared portico and tin covered cupola havearisen upon the bank The shore is composed of pebbles about twentyfeet high extending back one quarter of a mile where another step ofsix or ten feet brings you to a fine prairie leading to the bluffs Arow of buildings surmounted the banks principally shops but among themwe observed several small taverns as the Napoleon Coffee House UnionHotel and Washington Hall Upon a brick149 house farther in town mycompanion espied the sign of the Clinton Hotel which being the house towhich he had been recommended he accepted the services of the portersof that establishment who with those of the other houses had beensoliciting his custom How to land was the next consideration for uponrivers which have so great a rise and fall it is difficult to constructwharves After grounding backing fastening a stake in the mud for arope which immediately came out again we were at last stationary Aplank was then projected to the shore down which we were all trundledWe had now reached the end of our journey one hundred and seventy milesfrom Chicago and took leave of the Chicago line being left to our owndevices to wander farther We found the Clinton hotel a good house andcharges low being only one dollar and twentyfive cents a day each Thehost is a very gentlemanly person and the ladies of the family welleducated and agreeable We partook of a very good dinner of nativeproduce even to the wild raspberry tarts which appeared at desert Ilike this much more than being fed upon foreign dainties which one canprocure any where There was a picture in our dining room which was acomplete sign of the times upon it was painted a cider barrel fromwhich a man was drawing ‘hard cider’ bearing the motto ‘Old Tip’sclaims to the White House cannot be jumped’ This had been borne as abanner by the Peoria delegation at the whig convention of Fort Meigs Ifone might judge by what one sees Gen Harrison will have the votes ofall the west as he seems to be very popular as far as we have beenUpon returning to the parlor we found a centre table150 containingannuals and several excellent volumes of the best authors bearing thenames of the young ladies of the house While I looked over these mycompanion took up the Peoria Democrat and expressed his surprise to seesuch a paper in so new a place and in it such proofs of the trade ofthe place The type and paper were as good as any in our city andcontained advertisements of goods drugs wines fruits and otherarticles which makes one wonder how such things could find their waythere Another column explains this where are notices of steamboatswhich ply between this place and St Louis but three or four daysvoyage to New Orleans consequently one may command any thing here Inthree years the Michigan canal will be finished which will open acommunication with the Atlantic through the lakes and the New Yorkcanals Peoria cannot fail of being a place of much business forbesides the above named advantages the land around it is rich prairieinterspersed with wood land or timber as they call it here crossed byseveral mill streams It is but seventy miles from Springfield thecapitol of Illinois a large and handsome town doing a great deal ofbusiness and situated in the celebrated county of Sangamon Over the level country around Peoria good roads are laid out in everydirection A railroad is in contemplation from hence to the Mississippiat Warsaw while another the Bloomington and Peoria railroad is soonto be laid down from this to the Mackinaw river forty miles It is onthe high road from the gulf of Mexico to the north and alreadytravellers are taking this route to the eastern States We found151 here ayoung lady and her father who had come from Mobile They left there in asteamboat for New Orleans from thence other steamboats brought them upthe Mississippi to Quincy from whence they rode in a stage to PeoriaThey were on their way to New York and had taken this rout from itsnovelty In the afternoon we ramble down to the shores where I foundsome very pretty pieces of agate jasper and other pretty pebbles andgathered several singular shells and flowers The shells wereprincipally large muscle lined with pearl some of them beautifullyirredescent A neat cottage on the bank with its door open looked soinviting that we ventured to enter and ask for a glass of water Thewoman willingly filled a pitcher from a cool spring near and invited usto sit down She looked ill and the children around her were thin andpale I asked her the cause and heard a sad story of fever and aguesickness They had removed from Pennsylvania and had all been ill assoon as they arrived but had hopes of being after a while acclimatedThe cause of their sickness was as usual their exposure to the heavyfogs which arise from this river at night which strangers should avoidfor a year at least—and probably other imprudence Her husband was acarpenter who had sufficient employment where they had lived and therethey were well and happy To my question of the cause of their removalshe answered ‘Oh he had heard of the west where every one is sure toget rich and so he came’ Most of the emigrants we have met with couldgive us no better reason for removing hither than this woman They hearthe west spoken of as a great rich and rising country152 pull up theirhousehold by the roots and ‘westward hold their way’ I believe no onebut our people can thus readily leave their homes and the graves oftheir fathers to seek a residence in new and untried regions Among theemigrants we were often surprised to see so many from the neighboringStates Hoffman met a man during his ‘winter in the west’ who hadremoved his household from one end of the State of Michigan to theother merely because the mould was a foot richer at Kalamazoo—his ownbeing eighteen inches A man removes from the eastern border to the westof Pennsylvania Perhaps he there erects a house and in a few years seesa good farm around him another wishing to remove west offers him a sumfor it so much larger than his original outlay that he is tempted tosell and emigrate farther west He with this money purchases a place ofa man in Ohio who sells in the same way and passes on In a few yearsthe Pensylvanian again sells and again removes so that there is aconstant stream going step by step to fill up the immense plains andvalleys which here abound Fashions for emigration prevail a placebecomes popular every one is excited by the accounts of this newDorado and westward ho is the cry Boon’s Lick in Missouri Saltriver Platte river Oregon Rock river Wisconsin Michigan and Iowaeach have had its run and its partisans But there is ‘more than meetsthe ear’ in this fortunately their destinies are not left to theguidance of their own variable fancies There is an overruling Power atwhose command their steps are hither bent When I see them on theirmarch people from every nation men women and little ones and cattlewinding down153 the road in their wagons filling the steamboats andcrowding the stages all pressing in large bodies towards the land ofmilk and honey they remind me of the Hebrews plucked up from anovergrown country and led with an Almighty hand to the land ofpromise May these travellers study the eventful journey of thePalestine emigrants and shun those errors by which they were drivenforth from its fair fields The Hebrews were told if they would obeytheir heavenly leader ‘the land shall yield her increase and the treesof the field shall yield their fruit’—and ‘ye shall eat your bread tothe full and dwell in the land safely’ and ‘ye shall lie down and noneshall make you afraid’ ‘I will be your God and ye shall be mypeople’17 What magnificent promises And how powerful the promiserOh that these people would lay these words to their heart and considerwell the Hebrew’s fate They were also promised to be made ‘high aboveall nations which He hath made in praise in name and in honor’18There be those who predict this for our country let these read theconditions by which this maybe obtained and dread curses19 whichawait a failure We continued our stroll back of the town across theprairie or steppe upon which it is built to another about twelve orfifteen feet above it From thence is a fine plateau which reaches tothe bluffs As we sat upon this eminence the view was very pretty Thesun had been long gone but a delicate amber shaded with purple tintedevery thing Below us was the green prairie crossed with dark purplepaths over which the ‘lowing herds’ were winding slowly as if loth toleave their free pastures154 for the confinement of a barn yard Thecattle raised upon prairie grass are very fat and the Illinois beefcommands a ready sale in the New Orleans markets The butter and milk wemet with here was uncommonly rich equal to our first rate Goshenbutter Beyond the prairie is the town beneath which flows the quietIllinois bounded by dark forests and elevated bluffs While we werethus sitting enjoying the ‘coming on of grateful evening mild’ the deepsilence was broken by the sweet sound of a church bell echoing over theriver and the still forests At once these words of Milton so veryappropriate to our situation sprang to our lips There was apparently an evening meeting about to be held and werejoiced we should be enabled to enter the courts of the Lord aprivilege we had been denied for some time Our path to the town laypast several very pretty cottage residences ornamented with shrubberyand flowers—thence following the sound of the bell we found ourselvesbefore a small meeting house It happened fortunately to be the meetingwhich enjoyed the administration of the Rev Mr S——g of thepresbyterian persuasion whom we found to be a very pleasingintelligent and pious man We were very much gratified with hisdiscourse which we found very appropriate He spoke of man as atraveller the end of whose journey must certainly one day approach andearnestly bade us to take thought for that event as there were manythere who ‘before the frost is spread over our prairie may155 be lyingunder its sod’ He reminded us much of Amos the herdsman of Tekoa forhis similies were all drawn from rural objects—the sun the clouds theprairie the river and the scenery around him We no longer wondered atthe accounts we had received of the high religious and moral standing ofthe place and the great amount of good done in it This last yeartwentythree thousand dollars were contributed by the people of Peoriatowards charitable and religious institutions We walked home under abright moon our hearts much refreshed by all we had heard and we wererejoiced the Lord had placed such a faithful servant in these fairprairies to uphold his name July 9th—While wandering along the shore this morning we descriedthe smoke of our expected steamboat and hastened back to the hotel topack our trunks It was the Home from Peru to St Louis and we were totake passage in her for Alton on the Mississippi We bade adieu tosweet Peoria with regret The remembrance of it will long ‘perfume ourminds’ as old Izaak Walton says Its situation its excellent societyand religious privileges and its good schools must certainly make it adesirable place of residence or of trade It is two hundred miles fromSt Louis and one hundred and seventy from Chicago When in the saloonof the Home we were presented with a book in which to write our namesplace of residence whither bound and our politics While leavingthis our eyes fell upon a piece of pink satin framed which hungagainst the wall upon which was printed the rules of the boat Amongother things it forbid ‘any gentleman to go to table without his156 coator any other garb to disturb the company No gentleman must pencilworkor otherwise injure the furniture’ I suppose whittling was meant Uponour lake boat we saw the boxes of merchandize and barrels on deck fastdisappearing under the whittling knife A piece a foot long and twoinches wide would be torn from the box and cut to pieces by a restlesspassenger Beside these we were told ‘no gentleman was to lie down ina berth with his boots on and none enter the ladies’ saloon withoutpermission from them’ We found in this boat three indications of beingnear the south liquors upon the table gambling in the gentlemen’scabin and a black chambermaid slave to the captain Among thepassengers were a man with his wife and sons unlike the most I hadmet going west but making a retrograde motion to the east They weredriven away they said by the fever and ague from which they had beensuffering ever since their removal west Their yellow gaunt appearancefully testified to the truth of this He had been a shop keeper in theState of New York who experiencing some reverses was persuaded toremove to this golden region by his wife who was now no longer able tolead the village fashions He bought a lot and mill privilege in anembryo town—their house was situated under the boughs of a forestimpenetrable to the sunbeams surrounded by decaying leaves moist newsoil and a mill pond The town’s people were too busily occupied inbuilding banks and hotels to dig wells and drinking out of the marshysprings of course all fell ill by turns Their boy they said had beenat ‘death’s door’ and now although better was afflicted with an aguecake which they wished me157 to feel in his side I am convinced alittle prudence and knowledge will keep many ‘healthy wealthy andwise’ who without it are easily discouraged fall into difficultiesand wish to try a new place We have met many upon the road who havenearly equalled the old woman on the prairie who had begun the worldseven times The other female passenger was a young girl who had come down the riverin the boat her home being on the prairie back of Peru She was apretty innocent country lassie about sixteen travelling alone on avisit to a brother living on the river whose wife was ill and requiredher services Her travelling dress was a muslin striped with pink andher hat one of that description we call Dutch bonnets made ofpasteboard covered with pink glazed gingham She was rejoiced to examinemy wardrobe and cut new patterns as she lives far from the haunts ofmen and mantuamakers My Mosaic brooch pleased her much and she askedme if I had bought it of the pedlar who she heard had lately arrived inthat part of the country with a lot of new goods and whom she was eagerto see I was obliged to say I had not purchased it from thatfashionable depositary She then proposed to show me her clothes minebeing new to her she supposed her’s must be new and desirable to me Ather request the chambermaid drew from the stateroom a huge chest ofblack walnut which she opened and among other things displayed apretty straw bonnet trimmed with gay ribbons and flowers That was herSunday bonnet She also drew forth a topaz pin which had reached here ina pedlar’s cart and was a present to her by her brother ‘This pin haslasted158 wonderfully’ she said ‘considering how much it has beenborrowed At every dance or party when I do not go some of the girlsborrow and wear it It has been lent for ten miles around’ This younglady had been brought when quite young by her family from Ohio whencethey emigrated here They had all suffered much from the fever and aguebut were now acclimated or rather had corrected the causes of theiragues and she had become fat and rosy I have remarked in severalinstances that the children born here or brought here young grow upstrong and ruddy and their parents suffer the most It is only thefirst generation who lose their health as the land improves anddiseases vanish about their homes by the time their children are grownThis family live upon a large and productive farm which yields amongother things according to her account four hundred bushels of peachesIn the season of this delicious fruit her mother gives a peach feastinviting all their friends and acquaintances who after eating as muchas they like carry away each a basket full Her family sell severalbarrels of dried peaches every year Twelve miles below Peoria we stopped at the town of Pekin built upon abank elevated fifteen feet above the water during high tide but nowall these places are much higher The captain told us he should be heresome time taking in merchandize and we employed the interval in seeingthe lions of the town I told the little country girl our intention‘Lions’ she said ‘I guess you mean wolves there are no lions in theseparts’ Pekin is a small place and only contains eight or159 nine hundredinhabitants and five or six streets The shops seemed well filled withgoods and presented a goodly show of tin ironware drygoodscrockery provisions etc I purchased a green gauze veil here andseveral small articles all of which I found much more expensive than inour Atlantic shops freight being high on the Mississippi In paying forthem I found a new currency here my shillings and sixpences beingtransformed into bits and pics or picayunes The Pekin Express layupon the counter which we amused ourselves looking over while waitingfor change The person who kept the shop turned out to be the oldestinhabitant of the place that important personage who in a stormalways determines if there has been ever a greater one or no He mightvery well be the oldest as the town is but ten years in existence‘Pekin’ he said ‘would have been ere this far ahead of any town uponthe river were it not that there were two parties among thecommissioners who were to lay it out these pulling different ways thetown was nearly lost between them The rich country behind and theriver in front had befriended them and they soon expected to havetheir branch of the railroad finished to Mackinaw river whose waterpower and timber bluffs were very valuable’ We remarked as we walked alarge hotel nearly finished a presbyterian methodist and severalother meetinghouses office of the ‘Tazewell Telegraph’ academy andsome dwellings We lay here four hours with a hot sun reflecting fromthe sandy bank impatiently watching the barrels of flour which seemedas they would never cease rolling from the large storehouse upon thebank down to our vessel These barrels are160 from the steam flour millswhich turn out two hundred barrels a day Beside these we took in ahundred sacks of corn and some other merchandize The captain seemedwell pleased with his morning’s work saying he had a streak of luckthat day Three miles below this he had another ‘streak’ At the mouthof Mackinaw river scows were waiting him loaded with bundles of lathsand staves and long dark boards which I took for mahogany but whichproved to be blackwalnut The Mackinaw is a clear stream having richbottom land bounded by bluffs covered with white oak and cedar Theprairies through which it flows are rolling and tolerable land withseveral mill seats The Illinois looked beautiful this afternoon Its glassy waters scarcelymoved and it seemed so content with its sweet resting place and at thesilent admiration of those stately trees which were sending their coolflickering shadows over her and gazing down at loveliness that it wouldfain linger upon its course as some young languid beauty conscious ofa graceful position which is winning admiring glances from everybeholder Among the trees beside the usual elm oak and maple we observedseveral enormous wild cherry trees nearly one hundred feet in heightand at least fifteen feet in circumference and the paw paw the coffeenut the red ash American nettle a tall slender tree with pretty redberries and many unknown to us or to those around us The islands inthis river are small but covered with soft luxurious herbage The birdsand wild fowl were out enjoying themselves chattering pluming theirwings and visiting each161 other from tree to tree Among the wild fowlwe observed teal and brant and wild ducks skimming over the water orwheeling in flocks over our heads One apparently in a spirit ofdaring would set out to cross our path—leaving his little cove hewould glide with the utmost rapidity over the river in front of usleaving a silver line on the smooth surface of the stream and after wehad passed glide back bobbing up and down upon the waves in our wakeWhen he arrived at home what a quacking and chattering and flutteringwas heard In one little cove or bayou was a little island coveredwith rich grass and shaded from the sun by the dense grove whosebranches met over it—this seemed to be quite a colony of ducks whowere going and coming in rapid but graceful evolutions from the mainland A young man who stood near us named the place Quackville anddeclared when he returned home he would publish a map and sell off thelots We passed several towns to day as Liverpool HavannaBeardstown—the former a small settlement but which its inhabitantsintend to make larger as they have already a railroad in contemplationacross the Mississippi Beardstown is a place of some importance It isa county town and its commerce greater than any upon the riverMechanics of all descriptions are to be found here as bakers shoemakers tailors blacksmiths cabinet makers silver smiths carpentersjoiners coopers painters c c see Peck There are also here steamflour mills saw mills breweries distilleries c A canal isprojected here to connect the Illinois with the Wabash which dividesthe state of Illinois from Indiana by means of the Sangamon andVermillion162 forks While passing these towns one is surprised at theirrapid growth for when Schoolcraft rowed his canoe up this river twentyyears since it was a wilderness only inhabited by Indians OppositeHavanna the Spoon river enters the Illinois Its Indian name isAmequeon which means ladle and is much prettier than its presentname It is one hundred and forty miles in length navigable most of theway and capable of being cleared further The soil is dry undulatingprairie with considerable timber—and some of it upon the forks of theSpoon is the richest in the state—its forks and tributaries affordinggood mill seats It is in the military bounty land which commences justabove it and terminates at the junction of the Illinois with theMississippi making a triangle of five million three hundred and sixtythousand acres about ninety miles along the Illinois and the base ofthe triangle ninety miles across to the Mississippi near Quincy Thisis appropriated by Congress to the soldiers of the regular army in thewar between the United States and Great Britain Two thirds of this landis prairie and the rest timbered crossed by a variety of rivers andcreeks The soil is generally a black vegetable mould from fifteen tothirty inches deep Much of the best of this land has been bought up bya company who have opened an office at Quincy where they sell it fromthree to ten dollars an acre while other parts are sold at the pricegovernment established for its lands all over the States one dollar andtwentyfive cents an acre Government has given to the State of Illinoisevery other section Sangamon river comes gliding down over its pebblyfloor a pure transparent stream between Liverpool and Havanna It runsthrough Sangamon county of whose163 fertility beautiful scenery crowdedpopulation rich prairies numerous streams and valuable timber groveswe have heard such flourishing accounts By the way I can never getreconciled to the western custom of calling woods timber woodland orgroves or forest timberland My young country girl Maria in relatingan interesting romantic event which had occurred in her region ofcountry instead of speaking of a ramble in the woods said ‘we had goneto walk in the timber’ In this famed county is Springfield the capitalof the State The Sangamon river is one hundred and eighty miles longand navigable nearly to the capitol seventyfive miles by smallsteamboats With a small expense it can be cleared We do not see theIllinois in all its grandeur as the water is low It falls our captainsays one and a half inches a day and has fallen eight feet since JuneIt will arise in the autumn and when its present channel is fulloverflows the bottom land to the bluffs This makes the river shoreunless very elevated rather unhealthy and consequently uninhabitedSoon after passing the Sangamon we stopped to take in wood and weembraced the opportunity to take a sunset stroll in the forest A smallcottage embowered among woodpiles inhabited by a woodman and hisfamily were the only signs of human life we saw These sylvan solitudeshowever are not without their denizens for the birds were skippingfrom bough to bough the turtle were romantically reclining upon thelogs beside the water the wild fowls and the paroquets were chatteringin concert with the mocking bird There the squirrel also Here however in these pretty nooks he sits undisturbed for no boys‘with crooks and bags’ can molest his quiet haunts We enjoyed the deepforest walk very much having been now so long cramped in a steamboatand wandered along among the stately beech and graceful linden theblack walnut and locust swung upon the festoons of the enormous vineswhich hung down from the trees and breathed with much satisfaction theperfume from the dewy herbage grape vine buds and yellow jassaminwhich climbed the boughs around us The steamboat bell recalled us tothe shore in time to see a steamboat pass being the second we had metthis morning There is much travelling upon this river during the summer months Ourcaptain told us he had made fiftyeight trips last year from St Louisto Peru carrying ten thousand passengers This seems a great numberbut we are a travelling people and with the emigrants going west itmay be true I am chary of repeating things heard upon the road as Iknow my country people delight in quizzing travellers I have had someawful examples of this lately sufficient to make me cautious in regardto certain tourists from abroad to this country and when told any thingdubious remember the three miles of roast pig the drunken ladies ofBoston the piano with pantalets upon its legs the canvass bags tohold specie in times of bank troubles etc etc Pretty Maria’stravelling bonnet which I described to you also reminds me of themisconceptions to which travellers are liable who take a hasty glanceand go not to the best sources for information As proof of the povertyof the country low style of dress and manners an European traveller165tells his readers the richest ladies wear hats of their own manufacturemade of pasteboard covered with calico or gingham And so they do butonly to run in the garden or to a neighbor in the county for you knowwe all when in the county use these as garden hats as they shelterthe face so well from the sun I wish you could transport yourself hereat this moment and seat yourself by me upon the hurricane deck and seehow perfectly the forest shore is reflected upon the quiet polishedIllinois This stream cannot be called a flowing one for it has scarcelyany current but reposes in its bed with the tranquility of a lake Nowit lies in evening’s deep shadow while as we look above the topmostplumage is tipt with gold—this gradually disappears—darknesssucceeds except where one struggling moonbeam from the Indians Tibicgeezis night sun streams down the long forest vista and lies like asilver ribbon across the river I always go to bed with the chickenswhile on board a steamboat as a light attracts mosquetoes and hereriver fog forbids us to sit out of doors—so good night July 10—Off Meredosia This is a thriving town built upon one ofthose elevated terraces which occur frequently along the river as if onpurpose to raise the settlements above the damp alluvion and to givethem a pretty effect It is in a good situation to rise as it is a sortof business port to Jacksonville to which a railroad of twentythreemiles is in operation and Morgan county upon which it is situated isa thickly peopled district having good timbered lands mill streamsquarries of lime and free stone and is wa166tered by many streamsJacksonville is a large town where there are several churches a courthouse mills and shops The Quincy and Danville railroad passes throughMeredosia to the Wabash river two hundred and twenty miles Throughthis river communication is held with the lakes Their exports arebetween two and three hundred thousand dollars and imports five hundredthousand dollars Here we took in several passengers Six miles belowMeredosia is Naples a small collection of shops and dwellings situatedupon a high bank Upon one house larger than the rest I read the name‘Napoleon Coffee House’ I looked around for Vesuvious but saw it notnor any other Neopolitan traces The names upon this river are veryludicrous and striking monuments of the want of taste in those whobestowed them One would imagine from reading my last letter I hadbeen travelling in seven league boats or in a balloon as I havetouched at Peru Pekin Havanna Liverpool Naples Brussels Romepart in the night c While the Indian names are so pretty why arethey neglected for such worn out European designations Peoria andIllinois and Ottowa are very pretty Hennipen is very well as given inhonor of one of the early discoverers of this county from France and itmight be thought a debt of gratitude but every pioneer has not so gooda name and if this custom is followed it saddles us with such names asalready abound viz Jo Davies’ County Pike Cook HiggonbottomHancock Buggsville Toddtown Dodgeville Moreover the Indians werethe first explorers and if any they are entitled to this honor Toobviate this it has been proposed to take something local but un167lesspersons of taste are consulted we shall hear of more BigbonelicksBloodyruns Mud Lakes or Crab Orchard’s I wish Congress would take thematter in hand and form a committee of nomanclature to name every newsettlement We are constantly passing steamboats In 1836 at Beardstown there werefour hundred and fifty arrivals and departures and at Naples theiraccount was the first year 1828 nine from March to June 1832 onehundred and eight and now of course all these figures must be doubledAmong our passengers we have an old Kentucky woman who has been livingseveral years upon this river She was so rejoiced to see a slave againthat soon she and Violette our chambermaid became quite intimatefriends She frequently borrowed her pipe to have a comfortable smokeout upon the guards where with Violette beside her she would smokeand chat for hours A lady on board who had lately become a convert totemperance cause was extremely offended at the sight of spirits uponthe dining table Her husband argued for their use upon the ground offrequent impure water and fever and ague from which the stomach isfortified The wife however was not convinced when in the midst of ahigh argument our old woman put her head in at the door and taking outher pipe after slowly puffing off her smoke uttered this oracularsentence ‘For my part I think there are lots of gnats strained at andlots of camels swallowed’—and disappeared The husband left theargument for the card table whence he arose sometime after grumblingat his losses and galled by the discovery that the winner was a wellknown black legg whose practice168 was to live in steamboats duringsummer to fleece such silly sheep as himself In the winter he returnedupon his laurels to New Orleans or St Louis to revel upon hiswinnings This morning we passed one of those machines employed by governmentduring low water for the purpose of clearing away the sandbars It is alarge wooden ark worked by steam A great shovel takes up the mudbrings it up and throws it into the scow at the other side which isemptied upon the shores The State has appropriated 100000 toimprovements upon this river There are several sandbars and belowOttowa ledges of sandstone which if removed would render thenavigation unimpeded at all seasons of the year quite to Ottowa twohundred and ten miles above the mouth of the river We stopped so oftento take in freight and passengers that we began to be fearful we shouldnot reach the mouth of the river and behold its junction with thestately Mississippi before dark—however ‘we came a good jog’ thismorning to use our old Kentucky lady’s phrase and now after tea we aresitting upon the guards watching for it We are continually passingstreams which run into this river—Crooked creek comes down about onehundred miles through a very fertile region of country with a soil ofargillaceous mould from one to four feet deep20 Its banks are linedwith oak maple hickory black walnut and much other valuable timberBituminous coal and free stone quarries are also found there Applecreek at whose mouth is a small settlement Macoupin creek its nametaken from the Indian Maquapin a water plant169 whose smooth leaf floatsupon the bayous and lakes in this region its esculent root after beingbaked under heated stones is a favorite food with the native tribesThere is a settlement upon this last named stream commenced in eighteenhundred and sixteen which then was the most northern white settlementof Illinois The population of the State four years after in eighteenhundred and twenty was fiftyfive thousand two hundred and eleven andnow eighteen hundred and forty it is four hundred and twenty threethousand nine hundred and thirty four a great increase in twenty yearsWe have now upon each hand the two last counties which border theIllinois Green on the east contains excellent land well settled byeastern families many from Vermont It is one of the richest portionsof land in the State traversed by fine water courses and bounded by twolarge rivers—containing beautiful prairies and excellent timber Inthe cliffs which border the Mississippi on this county bituminous coalis found among the sandstone and limestone strata and crystal springsflow from their sides Calhoun county on our right is the southern pointof the triangle containing the military bounty lands The point wherethe Mississippi and Illinois meet is low prairie subjected to inundationand consequently unhealthy coal has been found here and the largetrees are famous for their honey As we were near the mouth of theriver and my little fellow voyager Maria had not yet landed I askedher how far we were from her brother’s residence She said she had beenlooking out for it but every place had a different name from that ofher brother I recommended her to ask the captain he sent her word we170had passed it twenty miles back Poor Maria seemed overwhelmed withconsternation The town we found upon enquiry was in the interior thepassengers landing at an old tree upon the shore and we all nowremembered a plain countryman upon the bank who made numerous signs tothe steamboat flourishing his arms frantically Maria with the restsupposed he was in jest or a madman but now remembered he was like herbrother who must have seen her and motioned her to stop Maria hadexpected a town and did not imagine that her stopping place As ourboat was so uncertain in its movements the poor man must have spent theday upon the shore and was now doubtless very anxious about his youngsister There was nothing for her to do now but stop in the steamboat atSt Louis until its return trip I felt sorry for the poor girl onlyfifteen and thus left to the tender mercy of the world We spoke to thecaptain and chambermaid who both promised to take charge of her andland her at her brothers when he returned next week The afternoon isbeautiful we are peeping up the forest glades as the channel runs nearthe shore or inhaling the rich perfume which the summer breeze shakesout from the trees Suddenly the forest is passed and we gaze over thelow prairie which lies between the two rivers bounded by a line ofround green hills which range across the country ‘The bluffs of theMississippi’ exclaimed my companion ‘and we soon shall see its famouswaters’ We hastened up to the hurricane deck and placed ourselves in agood situation for beholding the scenery a little excited at thethought of looking upon the grand and celebrated stream The Illinois171flowed as straight and still as a canal about four hundred yards widewe glided over its waters and soon found ourselves in a broad majesticstream which came rolling down between a range of bluffs here a milebroad upon whose bosom some lonely islands stretched across from themouth of the Illinois The view was delightful upon each side the fairplains of Missouri at our right and upon the Illinois side boldbeautiful cliffs or green cone like hills covered with a soft carpetof verdure sinking down upon the east side into lovely green dellsThis style of hill is called by the French Mamelle In one of thesepretty nooks nestled at the foot of a bluff is the town of Graftonfrom whose balconies the inhabitants obtain a fine view up theMississippi This town is only a few years old but expects soon torival Alton as most of the travelling from the interior to the Missouritowns opposite is through it It has already laid out upon paper arailroad to Springfield the capitol The rapid tide of the ‘father ofwaters’ presented a great contrast to the languid Illinois The coloris brown but of a different tint from the Illinois being a dark coffeebrown but clear and sparkling We looked a last farewell to the fairIllinois upon whose banks or on whose water we had travelled for fourdays and four nights a distance of nearly four hundred and fifty milesif we include the Des Plaines The loveliness of the scenery all thisdistance merits the encomiums made upon it by the early French writersThis was a favorite river with the French and La Salle Charlevoix andMarquette describe the beauty of its shores in glowing terms The bluffs upon the Illinois shore as we descend the172 Mississippibecome more bare and precipitous and have a waterworn appearance as ifthe water had once flowed along their summits The regularstratification of the sandstone and limestone of these cliffs presentthe appearance of mason work crowning the heights with castellatedresemblances so that we might imagine we were passing beneath somemountain fastness with its frowning walls dungeon keep and warder’stower Occasionally masses of white limestone are strewed along theshore or grouped upon the green sloping bank as if some large city hadthere arisen upon the river’s side Turning a sharp angle of one ofthose bluffs we found ourselves before a large imposing looking townbuilt upon the bank of the river which came sloping down from thebluffs behind This we learned was Alton While our crew were mooringour boat upon the steep bank we gazed with great curiosity and interestupon this place larger than any we had seen since leaving Detroitfourteen hundred miles behind To the left the rocks were crowned by alarge solid looking building which we were told was the penitentiary Infront was a row of high warehouses made of limestone filled with goodsand men while a mass of houses and steeples at our right were brightlyreflecting the rays of the sinking sun The shore presented a busyscene men and carts and horses were transporting goods or luggage orbusily employed Macadamizing the bank—a great improvement upon thewharves we had passed A large brick building at our right hand with awhite porch and steps bearing the sign of ‘Alton House’ being ourplace of destination we directed our course towards it The keeper173 ofthe house being absent and it being no one’s business to take care ofus we spent some time wandering about the well furnished parlors andstaring at the waiters who were washing up the tea things in thediningroom ere we could find any one to listen to our wants We hadleft behind us the land where a living is only to be obtained by effortand where the landlord and porters are on the alert in order to catchthe stranger and take him in Here the cool American manner obtainsand although to the hungry tired traveller rather annoying yet whenwe reflect upon the peace and independence and plenty which producesthis indifference he will do as we did throw himself upon a sofa keepcool and quietly await the arrival of somebody While amusing ourselves looking around at the furniture we observed aportrait of as we afterwards learned the master of the house As muchas we had heard of the wild independence the devilmecare manners ofour western brethren we were here taken by surprise He was without hiscoat—actually painted in his shirt sleeves—having upon his head an oldstraw hat It was probably a warm day or he was in too much of a hurryto put on his coat when he went to sit and besides it was nobody’sbusiness but his own how he was dressed or if he were dressed at alland I suppose we may be thankful he retained his white robe ‘any way’Luxury refinement and conventual forms may be carried to excess but Iam not prepared to say the other extreme is better A boarder in thehouse happening to stray in we told our wants and he kindly sent awaiter for the master of the house He came instantly and with thegreatest174 alacrity and wish to oblige took us up stairs All the roomsproving full or engaged except one too small we were directed toanother house which after a short moonlight walk we reached TheEagle tavern a favorite name for hotels I think in our country was acomfortable house although not pretending to the style and fashion ofthe Alton House And now having finished these last few lines while oursupper was preparing I hasten to bid you goodnight175 Alton July 11th My dear E—Harassed by no compunctious visitings for the enormouspackage which I dismissed to you this morning through the Altonpostoffice I have seated myself deliberately before my little desk toprepare you another We have spent a delightful day among our friendshere and are very much pleased with the towns of Alton for there aretwo of them We are now four o’clock waiting for the steamboat to takeus to St Louis and I employ the time in making a few sketches of theplace for you Alton is built as I told you upon a sloping bank Thisground is very uneven and upon some of the elevated portions are thepublic buildings The churches here are well built and numerous I thinkseven or eight the streets wide and airy places reserved for publicsquares and several handsome private dwellings The town has arisenrapidly and from a small town in 1832 it has now fine streets andhouses two hundred being built last year merchants who transactbusiness to176 the amount of several hundred thousand dollars and evenhalf a million in some instances Eight or ten steamboats are ownedhere and two railroads in contemplation and the great national road itis thought will be conducted through this place There are severalreligious societies here each having houses of worship among them thebaptist church is spoken of as being nicely fitted up in the interiorit is built of stone Every convenience and comfort of life is at handcoal in profusion in the vicinity of the town which is sold very cheaplimestone freestone and water lime besides other mineral productionsabound The markets are stored with wild game—deer partridges prairiehen and waterfowl fruits both wild and cultivated various sorts offish corn beef pork and vegetables of the finest order Madisoncounty in which it stands is one of the richest in the State beingmost of it upon the American bottom It contains seven hundred andninety square miles and the value of its productions exclusive ofcapital invested and cost of buildings amounts to two millions threehundred and sixtynine thousand one hundred and fiftyone dollars andeighty cents Of bushels of wheat they have raised one hundred andsixtyfive thousand five hundred and twenty Corn one million threehundred and four thousand three hundred and thirtyfive bushelsTobacco eleven thousand two hundred and eighty pounds Capital investedin manufactures two hundred and ten thousand four hundred andthirtyfive dollars But I suppose you do not care for these details IfI should come here again in a few years I expect to see Alton threetimes its size for although it may not rival St Louis as theinha177bitants imagine it must be the most considerable place after itwest of Cincinnati The Illinois brings to it the produce of thenorthern lakes and States—the Mississippi waft to its doors the exportsof the west and takes it over to the Ohio and to the gulf of Mexicofrom which last it is only four or five days distant The interests ofreligion and education employ the benevolent inhabitants to a remarkabledegree and many thousands are expended every year for the furtherance ofthese objects Among these are Shurtliff College Alton TheologicalSeminary Alton Female Seminary But enough of statistics you will sayand I hasten to our own personal adventures We ordered a carriagetoday to take us to Upper Alton to visit our friends there and werequite pleased to see as nice a coach and pair of horses as we could seein our own Broadway After leaving the town we drove through some richprairie land interspersed with trees through which we obtained fineviews of the swift rolling Mississippi and across it the verdant plainsof Missouri with green swelling hills beyond A drive of two milesbrought us to Upper Alton a pretty small looking village with spiresand neat dwellings peeping through the trees This place is verypleasantly situated upon an elevated plateau of ground about two milesfrom the lower town Families here enjoy great advantages in regard tothe education of their children as colleges and schools abound in itsneighborhood The society of this place is very superior and itssituation healthy We found our friends in a large picturesque house in the cottage stylesurrounded by piazzas whose pillars were wreathed with the clusteringMichigan178 rose and shaded by the graceful cotton wood and pretty redbud and locust Here indeed was a western paradise upon the Mississippibanks we found realized those visions so many have sighed after alodge in the vast wilderness a secluded retreat from the haunts of menwhere the confusions and follies of the world are only remembered as atroubled dream A charming young family and a well selected libraryrender this retirement most delightful A seminary upon a new plan hadbeen lately erected near their abode and with a view of showing usevery thing of interest around them our friends drove us in theircarriage through a pleasant road in an oak forest to the MonticelloFemale Seminary The building is of limestone of that region fourstories in height It stands within a lawn ornamented with groups oftrees and a fine garden is laid out in the rear This extensiveestablishment was founded by Benjamin Godfrey Esq a gentleman ofAlton who to this benevolent purpose devoted a large share of hisproperty While a resident of the west many examples had come beforehis eyes of the miseries arising from the imperfect education of theyoung women who settle here The dearth of servants rendered itnecessary for the young wives around him to superintend if not assistin household labor and he saw how much better it was they should comeprepared for these duties and quite able to perform them instead ofwearing themselves out and pining away over tasks which by being newappear much more arduous than they are in reality As the evil lay in adefective system of education this generous individual at once saw howgreat a desideratum an institution would be uniting useful withornamental179 accomplishments With a public spirit to be much applaudedMr Godfrey erected this spacious building for educating ‘wives for thewest’ Eighty young ladies is the limited number all to be overfourteen years of age With the course of scientific study usual infemale seminaries the pupils are taught music instructed in religionand in various household duties Among other lessons they are taughtto set a table arrange their rooms even sweep and scrub them washstarch and iron all their clothes Some young ladies who had been bredin idleness or who had come from the indulgent homes of Alton orluxurious mansions of St Louis where slaves await their nod were veryreluctant at first to undertake these menial employments but theadvantage which so good a school presented in its other departmentsrendered their mothers deaf to their complaints They were soonhowever broken in and sing as merrily over their wash tubs as theother pupils As gain is not the object of its generous founder theprice of admission is placed low still there are some whose means aretoo straightened for even this and these are allowed to pay for theirinstruction by labor in the house The eagerness to get admittance foryoung persons is very great and many thus receive instruction who areof high respectability and are enabled to attend to the youngerbranches of the family or even if required teach others Some ofthese young persons are beneficiaries of a benevolent society calledthe ‘Ladies’ Association for Educating Females’ The object of thissociety is to ‘encourage and assist young females to qualify themselvesfor teaching and to aid in supporting teachers in those places180 wherethey cannot otherwise be sustained’ Young females of all ages areselected from poor families and placed in schools where they arewatched over by these benevolent ladies their tuition paid and toeach every year is addressed a circular letter of advice with thedonation of an appropriate instructive book When prepared they areplaced in situations where they can support themselves Several havebecome missionaries and at this school are two of the Cherokee tribewho are preparing to be teachers among their people The great amount ofgood performed by these ladies entitle them to the hearty wishes of thebenevolent and patriotic The Rev J Spalding in his address beforethe seventh annual meeting at Jacksonville says ‘Since itscommencement it has aided one hundred and fortyseven young ladies intheir preparation for usefulness and heaven thirtyone of whom areprofessed followers of the Lamb’ Now that I have thoroughly describedthe institution we will leave the carriage and enter the house We wereshown into a neatly furnished parlor where we were soon joined by theprincipal of Monticello the Rev Theron Baldwin a gentleman of greatinformation and piety He kindly explained to us the principle uponwhich the seminary was conducted and then offered to show us the houseEvery thing was arranged with the greatest order and neatness Thedining school and recitation rooms were large clean and airy andthe bed rooms commodious Upon the ground floor was a chapel fitted upwith the beautiful black walnut of their woods here divine service isperformed by the Rev Mr Baldwin to the school and people of theneighborhood who assemble181 there every Sunday You see the Illinoispeople are determined their people shall enjoy the blessings ofeducation and when we reflect how much the destiny of our nationdepends upon the next generation we cannot devote our time or our moneyto a better purpose than furthering such institutions We left theseminary pleased with its arrangements and wishing all success to thegenerous individual who originated the establishment It is delightfulto see wealth so well employed to behold the ‘just steward’ thus ablydisposing of his master’s property Such disinterestedness shone out inbold relief from the selfish and reckless waste of fortune which we hadbeheld in our pilgrimage like one of his own ‘oak islands’ upon asunny and treeless prairie Once more we experienced the pains of parting and were forced to leaveour friends that afternoon We returned to our hotel where we areawaiting the arrival of our steamboat which is to take us to St LouisWhen I look around in this interesting country and upon such towns asAlton I wonder why our Atlantic cities are so full of people How manyyoung men do I know there and indeed whole families who arestruggling for a living and denying themselves every comfort that theirspare income may suffice to give them a showy appearance in publiccrammed into crowded boarding houses narrow hot dusty streets whenthere is here in this wide beautiful land room fresh air finescenery employment everything to be enjoyed at half the expense theyare forced to lay out among so many discomforts The steamboat bellwarns me to put up my note book and I will resume when aboard182 We found ourselves in a small steamboat which makes regular tripsbetween this town and St Louis twentyfive miles Alton looked verypretty when we turned to bid a sorrowful adieu and we regretted ourtime would not allow us to remain in this interesting place We are nowall eagerly looking out for the giant Missouri whose junction with theMississippi is but two miles below Alton At length the point is inview all gather upon the guards and bend our eyes towards the rightshore—we are now before the mouth and behold an extraordinary sceneThe Missouri does not as travellers tell us come rushing andbounding and dashing along striking the Mississippi with such aconcussion that volumes of mist arise in the air—we beheld nothing sowonderful—a broad stream rolled down between its verdant banksrapidly and very like a torrent but in quite a decent and propermanner Its color—alas for our pellucid lakes—is a tint not oftenrecognized by artists but generally called gruel or soapsuds hue Itholds in solution such an extraordinary quantity of clay that onewonders how the steamboat can force its way through it Its rapidcurrent is distinguished by the curls and little whirlpools among themud Where it meets the Mississippi is a small ridge of clay and thickmasses push themselves under the clear brown water coloring it more andmore with its impurity until at last the unhappy Mississippi afterstruggling for some time is completely lost in the clayey stream assome pure young heart striving against temptation but lost at lastThe streams continue separate for some miles below St Louis and therethe river takes the Missouri character I looked up183 the vista of thisgrand stream as we passed its mouth with sentiments of awe A mightymass of water—it came rolling down nearly four thousand miles from itssource in the wild recesses of the Rocky Mountains bearing upon itsbosom not a fleet of Argosies but materials for their construction inwhole forests of gigantic trees Such an admirer of water as you know I am you may be sure I regrettedthe soiling of my bright brunette Mississippi To watch the foam of ourvessel had been a favorite pastime but alas what a change from thediamond and emerald of our lakes the topaz of the Illinois the Zirconof the Mississippi to the soapsuds of the Missouri I have called theMississippi coffee color it is now coffeeaulait and indignant mustthe father of waters be under so great an oppression Several greenislands adorn the stream and the shores are spotted with a few housesand now chimney and roof and tower piled up against each otherproclaim a city and we are soon in sight of the city of St Louis Anold castellated Spanish mansion is the first relic we have seen of thatbrave Castilian race which once reigned over these broad lands It is Ithink their ultima thula their most northern point The appearanceof St Louis from the water is very much like Albany as it is builtupon rising ground consisting of two plateaus of land the lastelevated several feet above the other but its water craft gave it quitea different character We are used in our cities to behold the waterfront bristling with masts but here we saw steamboats alone therebeing about seventy moored at the wharves which gave a novel andwestern appearance to the scene184 The flat boat is fast disappearingand steamboats are the only style of boat with few exceptions whichwe see of these five hundred and eightyeight have been built upon thewestern waters21 The city of St Louis stretches a mile along theelevated shore and nearly the same distance back We almost fanciedourselves in New York again so great was the stir upon the wharf Thewarehouses of brick or limestone made of the rock upon which theystand appeared filled with goods and customers boxes and bales cartsand barrows were floating about and every one seemed active except thenegro slaves who were plodding about their work with the usualnonchalant gait of this merry but indolent nation We missed our goodwharves at home and even the paved bank of Alton for a shower hadrendered the shore muddy Surely some Yankee might contrive a morecommodious landing something that might rise and fall with the riveror a long pier We drove to the Missouri House where we arrived in timefor tea and at night were lulled to sleep by a Spanish guitar andchattering of French voices from the shops and cafes in ourneighborhood185 St Louis July 12 My dear E—The days we have spent here we have been very busyexcept Sunday in examining every thing in and about this place It is avery nice city and one of much importance has increased much latelyand will continue to increase Its population is twentyfour thousandfive hundred and fiftyfive In 1825 it was only six thousand There areseveral good churches here some of which we attended today it beingSunday There is a pretty episcopal of the Gothic form a baptistchurch of brick having a neat white porch in front—an unitarian ofplaster—a methodist and a large cathedral belonging to the catholicsThis is an odd picturesque building and is one hundred and

altar are veryhandsome the windows of painted glass and there is in the church afine186 painting of St Louis presented by Louis XVIII The bells arefrom Normandy We had penetrated two thousand miles in the wilderness ofthe west and were glad to find we had not yet ‘travelled beyond theSabbath’ What nice resting spells these Sabbaths are When whirled upon thestream of life our attention occupied in avoiding the snags and sawyersand cross currents in our channel how refreshing how necessary is itfor us to anchor for a little while and look about and consider ourfuture course The Sabbath is a precious anchor to the soul giving ittime to meditate upon its future career and consult those charts whicha kind heaven has sent to direct its route The Sabbath is necessary toman and was given in mercy Physicians tell us rest is required for themachinery of man that the brain and nerves while forever upon thestretch will decay much sooner than if sometimes relaxed It was theopinion of the great Wilberforce that the suicide of Lord Londonderryand that of Sir Samuel Romilly was owing to their neglect of this day ofrest Speaking of the death of the former he says ‘he was certainlyderanged—the effect probably of continued wear and tear of the mindBut the strong impression of my mind is that it is the effect of thenonobservance of the Sabbath both as abstracting from politics fromthe continual recurrence of the same reflections and as correcting thefalse views of worldly things and bringing them down to their ownindistinctness He really was the last man in the world who appearedlikely to be carried away into the commission of such an act so coolso self possessed It is very curious187 to hear the newspapers speakingof incessant application to business forgetting that by a weeklyadmission of a day of rest which our Maker has graciously enjoined ourfaculties would be preserved from the effects of this constant strain Iam strongly impressed with the recollection of your endeavors to prevailupon the lawyers to give up Sunday consultations in which poor Romillywould not concur If he had suffered his mind to enjoy such occasionalrelaxations it is highly probable the strings would never have snappedas they did from over extension’ July 13th—This morning we took a coach and drove about to everything worth seeing in the city In the French part of the town thestreets are narrow and present quite a foreign and antique appearanceHere are several neat whitewashed steep roofed dwellings surrounded bypiazzas and occupied by the French part of the community Main streetwhich corresponds with our Pearl street runs parallel with the riverabout a mile It appears a very busy street and here one may obtaingoods from all quarters of the world brought up from New Orleans—anddomestic wares from the country around As you ascend from the river thestreets are wider and better built and the upper end of the city islaid out in wide streets fast filling up with handsome buildings publicand private some of these last surrounded by courts and adorned bytrees Here many eastern people dwell A gentleman of the place told usthere had been nine hundred houses put up in the city this year andfrom appearances I should think this a true estimate There is a medicalcollege in progress and a large hotel188 nearly finished which is saidto be the largest hotel in the States It is of red brick ornamentedwith white marble and is altogether a handsome building It is to becalled the ‘St Louis House’ Several institutions are conducted bycatholics as the Convent of the Sacred Heart and the University of StLouis In the library of the latter are nearly seven thousand volumesThe court house is of brick with a circular portico supported by whitecolumns It stands in a large court in the centre of the city surroundedby an iron railing We entered the hall and ascending to the cupolabeheld a very delightful scene The city is laid out as in a map belowus—behind stretch the verdant prairies in front the swift rollingMississippi and beyond it the rich fields of the American bottoms inIllinois and the white buildings of Illinois town opposite Whileleaving the court house we were attracted by some advertisements uponthe door for the sale of slaves We noticed one for the sale of‘Theresa a likely negro girl about twelve years of age’ This was ourfirst intimation we were in a land of slavery You must not expect adissertation upon slavery for whatever my opinions are I shall keepthem to myself as I cannot mend or alter the state of things by myadvise nor is it a woman’s province to meddle in such high matters ofState However I might think I certainly shall never speak in publicupon the subject as I have a good old friend called St Paul and hein one of his letters says ‘It is a shame for a woman to speak inpublic’ and ‘women should be keepers at home’ It is true I am not akeeper at home just now but I am travelling for health and not toenlighten the people with my wisdom The num189ber of slaves in Missouriis forty eight thousand nine hundred and fortyone—its entirepopulation is five hundred thousand We visited a museum herecelebrated for its collection of organic remains and we were surprisedat the number and good preservation of these ‘medals of creation’ Theowner and keeper of this museum is Mr Koch a man of great enthusiasmupon the subject of paleantology He had just returned from anexpedition to the interior of Missouri from whence he had procuredninety weight of bones Seeing our interest in these things he admittedus into an interior room which had the appearance of a charnel housefilled with bones and skeletons which his servant was covering withpreparation to preserve them from the effects of the air Among themwere gigantic remains of the mastodon and other huge animals with teethin excellent preservation This museum contained many well preservedspecimens the most important of all was a huge animal with tusks whichhe called missourium He found also a head of an unknown animal which iscertainly the largest quadruped whose remains have been discoveredhaving two horns each ten feet long extending out horizontally on eachside making with the head a length of twentyfive feet from the tip ofone tusk to that of the other The missourium so called from the Statein which it was found was an animal much larger than the elephanthaving tusks measuring four and a half feet in length and one and ahalf in circumference near the head These animals with theantediluvial reindeer and horse of a large size and myriads of brokenbones were found by Mr Koch last May near the sulphur springs atLittle190 Rock creek twentytwo miles south of St Louis They were in avalley surrounded by high cliffs this great deposit of bones forming an‘osseous brescia such as is found upon the east coast of theMediterranean sea’ ‘The lower strata upon whose surface these boneswere deposited’ says Mr Koch in his written description which he gaveus ‘consists of a bluish sand resembling that which is often found uponthe bottom of the Mississippi’ These bones were cemented in a layer ofgravel one and a half feet in thickness The cement is calcareous of ayellow grey color containing saltpeter It combines the bones andgravel together so that it is with the greatest difficulty they can beseparated this layer is covered with a crust of chrystalization Thenext strata is composed of small pieces of rock and bones broken andin some instances ground to powder these rocks are limestone some ofthem weighing several tons The next strata is blue clay from two tofour feet in thickness containing few bones this clay is covered withbroken rocks again above which is the soil covered with trees Thewhole mass makes a hill sloping down from the rocky bluff of thirty orforty feet to the creek Mr Koch is of opinion these animals herdedtogether and sought shelter under these cliffs during some greatconvulsion of nature and here met their death by being crushed bycrumbling rocks and covered with debris Here we saw also the remainsof that animal which I mentioned in one of my former letters as havingbeen killed by human hands Beneath it had been built a fire of woodand around it were Indian axes and large pieces of stone which had beenthrown at it191 as if for the purpose of killing it The animal hadevidently been mired and killed by the inhabitants This is a discoveryof great importance proving the mastodon according to Indiantradition had lived since the deluge He showed us the elephant fishor spoonbill taken from a lake in Illinois which was saturated withoil although it had been cleaned and dried several years also somelive specimens of prairie animals—the wolverine the prairie wolf andthe marmot or prairie dog a small grey animal famous for dwelling inthe same nest with the prairie owl You have heard of this prairie dogwhose villages extend over many acres in the prairies they burrow underthe ground having over the entrance to their hole a small mound abouttwo feet high and eighteen inches wide Charles Lucien Bonaparte says ofthem ‘It is a very odd circumstance that this owl and dog should sharethe same habitation but so it is and they present an example of unitywhich is quite pleasing’ Another striking feature in the case of theseanimals is they make the same cry cheh cheh pronounced severaltimes in rapid succession In the afternoon we strolled out to the suburbs of the town to see theIndian mounds several of which are grouped together near the riverbank in the environs of the city One of them is enclosed within thegrounds of General Ashley an ornament as rare as it is beautiful Uponanother is built the city waterworks Upon one about twenty feet higha truncated cone covered with soft grass we seated ourselves enjoyingthe silence and watching the Mississippi’s flood rolling below uswhile we mused upon the fate and fortunes of these ancient ‘moundbuilders’ The192 thermometer had stood at ninetysix all day and we wereglad to escape the heat and dust of the city The sun had disappearedbut had left a soft amber radiance upon shore and river and a purplehaze upon the tops of the distant bluffs of Illinois While gazing uponthese monuments and looking at the relics of a lost race which theycontain we try in vain to pierce the mists of time and answer the ‘whowere they’ which we ask ourselves The vast valley between theAlleghany mountains and the Rocky or Chippewayan chain is studded withthese antique mounds from three feet to two hundred feet in heightThey are generally in the form of a parallelogram except in thenorthwest where they take the shape of a cone and by a late discoveryin Wisconsin they are seen taking the figure of men and animals Thereis a human effigy which is one hundred and twentyfive feet long theothers are rude resemblances to the buffalo birds alligator etcthese are all lying down upon the surface of the earth Our Indiantribes each take the name of an animal as fox beaver buffalo etcwhich custom might have also prevailed with the effigy builders Thereare several grouped together here around the one upon which we aresitting and several upon the Illinois shore opposite These lastconsist of small ones surrounding a larger one which has acircumference of six hundred yards at the base and is ninety feet inheight half way down the side is a step or platform cut into the hillabout fifteen feet wide It is called Monk’s hill from the circumstanceof its having been the residence of some monks of La Trappe who duringthe troubles of the revolution fled to this country and built a houseupon this193 mound Here they kept a garden and supported themselvesselling its produce at St Louis and by repairing clocks and watchesTheir penances were very severe What an illustration of Shakspeare‘patience on a monument’ were these old men while meditating upon atumulus in a howling wilderness In vain we puzzle our brain as to thecause of these structures and ask are they erected for mausoleumswatch towers or temples Those which have been opened contain humanremains ancient pottery instruments of war and are evidently placesof sepulchre Some of them contain rude earthen vases which had beenfilled with food for the use of the deceased In vases discovered in anIndian sepulchre near Steubenville upon the Mingo Bottom were bonesof turkies oppossums c which had been placed there that theirfriends might not want food upon their journey to the land of spiritsStone pipes are also found cut out of their sacred red clay of StPeters or steatite greenstone and limestone some bearing resemblancesto eagle’s or other bird’s heads Arrow heads of flint or quartz arealso found with the former article with idols silver and copper ringsand rosaries You have heard I suppose of the circle of mounds aroundwhich is built the town of Circleville upon the Scioto river of OhioHere was an ancient city enclosed by a double wall of earth with aditch between the walls The walls and ditch occupy nearly seventy feetwhich gives thirty feet as the base of each wall and ten for the widthof the ditch This circular town or it may be fortification was threehundred and fifty yards across A square fort is near this the walls ofwhich were twenty feet wide without194 any ditch The fort is threehundred yards across and is an exact square The present town is laidout on these ancient and venerable works the court house built in theform of an octagon stands in the centre of the circular fort andoccupies the spot once covered by a large and beautiful mound but whichwas levelled to make room for the building This forms the nucleusaround which runs a circular street with a spacious common betweenthe court house and street on this street the principal taverns andstores are erected and most of the business done Four other streetsrun out of the circle like radii from a centre On the south side ofthis circle stands a conical hill crowned with an artificial mound astreet has lately been opened across the mound and in removing theearth many skeletons were found in good preservation A cranium of oneof them was in my possession and is a noble specimen of the race whichonce occupied these ancient walls It has a high forehead large andbold features with all the phrenological marks of daring and braveryPoor fellow he died overwhelmed by numbers as the fracture of theright parietal bone by a battleaxe and five large stone arrowssticking in and about his bones still bear testimony22 We must regret the destruction of these mounds but in consideration ofthose which are allowed to remain undisturbed and of the taste andfancy displayed by the citizens of Circleville in laying out their townamong them we may forgive them There is an ancient fortification nearthe junction of the195 river Wisconsin with the Mississippi in the anglesof which mounds are erected Upon the plantation of Walter Irvin Esqabout ten miles from Natchez and seven from the Mississippi is anothervery singular group of fortifications and tumuli If you desire myopinion I should decidedly say they were erected over the slain inbattle Sometimes they contain but one body perhaps of some greatchieftain whom the enemy’s archers have stricken others are erectedover several bodies laid in layers who as fast as they have fallenhave been laid upon the mound the earth placed over them to receiveanother layer until the tumulus is finished Where they are groupedtogether and where fortifications remain the spot may have been thefield of some great battle whose slaughtered ranks required many moundsto cover them We know it was the custom of eastern nations to erectmounds over the dead The army of Alexander erected over the body ofDemeratus a monument of earth eight cubits high and of vastcircumference Semiramis raised a mound to the memory of Ninus We readof their erection by the Babylonians in their trenches during siegesWho were the people that erected these tumuli is wrapped in mysterywhich I shall not endeavor to penetrate but refer you to Delafield’sAntiquities of America who seems to have discovered much in the Mexicanrecords which throws light upon the subject It is his opinion theywere Sycthians who crossed to this country over Behring’s Straits andthese people were once the builders of the tower of Babel and dweltupon the plains of Shinar When dispersed by the confusion of tongues aportion of them wandered through Tar196tary to the ocean and therecrossed and gradually passed down the North American continent toMexico and Peru He deduces his evidence from 1st Philology—asthreefifths of the American dialects resemble the language of northernAsia twofifths the Coptics and others the Sycthian which last hetraces in the tribes of South American and the others to the NorthAmerican savages 2nd Anatomy which proves ‘there is much resemblancebetween the cranium of the race of the mounds and ancient Peru withthose of the modern Hindoos’ mythology and hieroglyphics architecturemanners and customs The pyramids of Mexico Peru our country and theSycthian nations are the same with little variation some of earthand others of stone Mr Delafield gives a plan of a building used as areceptacle of the remains of the princess Tzapotee in Mexico which muchresembles some of the ruins in Ohio This is called Mignitlan the placeof desolation In the article upon manners and customs he relates thediscovery of some shells of the pyrula perversa in a tumulus which areused in Asia at religious ceremonies and only found upon the coasts ofIlindostan He traces these nations from the plains of Shinar toTartary where are numerous mounds some in groups as they are foundhere all containing bodies with idols and implements of warprovisions c In his interesting book he exhibits the celebratedAztec map upon which by hieroglyphical figures their course is tracedfrom Behring’s Straits to Mexico and Peru Among other figures we seethere a boat rowed by a man meaning crossing the water a large treeindicating their arrival from the icy regions to a fertile land a197rushing river telling of the Mississippi and lastly a Mexican plantdenotes their arrival in that land Surrounding and between thesefigures are hieroglyphics signifying battles towns built sacrificescouncils feasts c and the number of years that the tribe remainedin one place He has sustained his hypothesis very ably and yet we maysay with Schoolcraft this is a race ‘whose origin whose history andwhose annihilation live only in conjecture’ It is to be hoped thecitizens of St Louis are aware of the treasures enclosed within thecity and will take measures for their preservation—the place would becapable of much ornament as a public garden As our country becomessettled these interesting reliques will be destroyed if care be nottaken to prevent it Their number may give us an idea of the myriads whoonce roved over these plains and we may say while passing through theregions of the west we are travelling over a ‘buried world’ Besidethese races the Spanish French English and Americans have lived anddied here The city of St Louis which is now so filled with Americans that it israpidly assuming an American appearance was once inhabited by Frenchalone The founder M Auguste Choteau was alive when La Fayette visitedhere but very aged When young enterprising and ardent he led theexpedition which in seventeen hundred and sixty four ascended the riverto found a city He selected the site and with his own axe struck downthe first tree houses soon arose and the limestone rocks around as ifby magic were transformed into ware houses As the French influence inthe country was lost the town stood still198 until the American emigrantsflowed in and since then it has rapidly arisen to its presentflourishing state doing a business of six millions of dollars annuallySt Louis is the capitol of the far west and must continue to increaseIt is the central point of the great valley of the Mississippi whichextends two thousand five hundred miles in width from the Alleghany orApalachian mountains to the Chipewayan and three thousand miles inlength It is seated upon a noble river by which it is only three daysvoyage to the Mexican gulf—only eighteen miles from the mouth of thegrand Missouri thirty six from the great artery of Illinois and twohundred from the Ohio through whose waters it has access to everyportion of the States Behind it is a noble region of land watered bymagnificent rivers abounding in metals coal and stone quarriescovered by a rich soil and blessed with a mild climate July 14th—The morning being fine we were advised to take some of thefashionable drives and accordingly sat out for the Prairie House Thecitizens could not choose a pleasanter place to enjoy fresh air andverdure As we left the city we passed several handsome country seatsand then found ourselves in the prairie which is of the species of landcalled ‘barren’ covered with dwarf oak crab apple hazel bushes andprairie plums The road wound through copses and tufts of shrubbery forthree miles when we arrived at the Prairie House which is a prettybuilding surrounded by shade trees and gardens After cooling ourselveswith ice creams we reentered the carriage and drove three milesfurther199 to the Sulpher Springs Leaving the coach at the door of alarge house we descended a deep dell shaded by weeping elms immenseoaks and beeches among which ran a brook ‘that to the sleepy woods allnight singeth a quiet tune’ The water was bright and sparkling butvery nauseous and tasted to my companion like the Harrowgate watersThe walks around this stream are very pleasant and must be quiterefreshing to the tired and heated citizen There is much company hereduring the summer We took another road home and passed through a fineprairie the commencement of the celebrated Florisante prairie whichstretches from St Louis to the Missouri Although trees were groupedupon the plains we passed several spots In returning we passed a load of fine looking coal which we were toldcame from Manchester a small town a few miles distant At two o’clock we went on board the steamboat Monsoon in which we wereto go to Cincinnati Every minute we expected to go but hour after hourpassed away and still we did not move To our questions the captain gaveseveral reasons for the delay which seemed very vexatious to him Weendured the day as hot as it was by amusing ourselves with readingwriting looking at the opposite shores which we should have visited bymeans of the steam ferry boats which were crossing continually toIllinois town had we not imagined we were soon to depart—and inwatching the busy crowds upon the wharf among whom was an old negrobefore an auction200 store attracting customers by ringing a bell insteadof using a red flag as with us—but when night came and we were obligedto pass it in our hot narrow berths among mosquetoes which no net wouldkeep off—listening to the noise and profane converse of the crew of theboats around and imbibing the perfume of a dock we became very muchvexed and very impatient to be on our way July 15th It was ten o’clock this morning before we started and thendiscovered it was the arrival of a large party of St Louis fashionableswhich had kept us stationary and who instead of coming as expectedchose to remain to attend a party that night We who had been used to the punctuality of our eastern cities wherethe captain stands watch in hand to give the signal for moving at theappointed moment were extremely annoyed at such proceedings but beforewe grumble too much it may be as well to look upon the other side of thequestion The steamers upon these rivers make long voyages and requiremuch freight and passengers to pay their expenses From St Louis to Cincinnati is eighthundred miles for which we wereto pay twelve dollars each and finding only a few passengers engagedthe captain waited for this party hoping in the meanwhile some of theupper steamboats would arrive and bring him some more freight orpassengers The only thing we could reasonably complain of was his badfaith if he had openly told us the state of the case we should havequietly remained in our hotel awaiting his summons instead of placingthe delay to the broken machinery some hands missing provisions201 notarrived c off at last amids the shouted adieu from the motley crewof Negro French Spaniard and Yankee which lined the guards of thelong range of steamboats lying along the front of the city There areone hundred and sixty steamboats plying between this city and otherports The city and its spires now fades away and we station ourselvesin a favorable position for beholding this famous country The Illinoisshore is low covered with forest and is the rich part of the Statewhich was called by the Spaniards American bottom bottom land beingthe alluvion which is found upon the river shores between the water andthe bluffs and which is usually overflowed at high water A featurepeculiar to the county is the land nearest the river is highest owingto the constant deposit and when the water retires lakes are left alongthe low land which gradually dry away This bottom extends from theKaskaskiah river to the mouth of the Missouri two miles from Altoneighty miles—and from one half to two miles in length to the bluffswhich bound it containing two hundred and eightyeight thousand squareacres The soil is of inexhaustible fertility averaging from twenty totwentyfive feet Coal is abundant in this alluvion and in the bluffsThis is carried to St Louis in great quantities over the railroad toIllinois town The Missouri side rises into high limestone bluffs uponwhich is built near the city Jefferson barracks a fine quadrangularbuilding containing fifteen hundred United States troops and a fewmiles farther Herculaneum having at the edge of the cliff a high shottower Near this tower is a bowlder of vermiculae limestone fifty feetby three hundred Through202 a cleft in the rocks comes rushing down theclear bright Maramec It takes rise among hills covered with pine treesso valuable in this region Its banks are rich with lead iron and saltand has formerly been a favorite haunt of the Indian tribes from thequantity of pottery bones and arrow heads found there Behind thesecliffs commences the celebrated lead region where such quantities areexported The mineral region of Missouri Iowa and Wisconsin arestated by Dr Owen the State geologists to be capable of producingmore of this article than the whole of Europe Missouri sends some toChina and has exported this year to that country five hundred pigs oflead to be used for lining tea chests The rocks appear broken up inodd fantastic shapes taking the name of devil’s tea table backboneoven grand tower etc This last in a tall solitary rock about onehundred feet high covered by a tuft of cedars its stratification asdistinct as if it was a stone tower The cornice rocks are a ledge whichruns along the top of the bluffs for nearly ten miles These rocks aresaid by geologists to have been once the barrier of a large lake orinland sea over them poured another niagara which wearing throughthem caused their jagged appearance When it burst through it carriedwith it and deposited that enormous mass of alluvion which extends anhundred miles into the gulf of Mexico The rock along this shore ismostly a blue compact limestone thought by Schoolcraft to be the musclekalck of the Germans sometimes it occurs fœtid Near the city of StLouis in this limestone were found the impressions of two human feetas if the person had stood upon it while soft The impres203sions wereperfect and were not sculptured in the rock This slab was cut out andtaken to New Harmony upon the Wabash The scenery I am attempting to describe is very beautiful and variedThe broad river about a mile wide carries us rapidly along frompromontory to point crowned by a village ever showing us new beautiesThe high wall at our right hand is not a mere line of rocks butsupports the land which commences from their summits as if the riveronce flowing at that height had gradually worn its way down Thishowever is not the case the deep bed having been scooped out bydiluvial torrents An amateur of geology at Alton has another theoryand attributes the location and course of their rivers to fissures inthe coal measures One side of the fractured strata is raised and theother depressed so that perpendicular rocks do not appear upon bothsides of the rivers Whether this be the cause of their direction I knownot but that the cliffs occur upon but one side of the stream Iobserved upon the Illinois and Mississippi St Genevieve which wepassed this afternoon is one of those old French towns which werebuilt during the sway of France over these fertile regions We stoppedat the landing where are a few houses while the village is a shortdistance up the Gabouri creek upon which it is built We could see thesteep slate roofed French houses neatly whitewashed the court houseand catholic church whose cross glittered in the afternoon sun Besidethe river is a fertile portion of land which was allowed to the town bythe Spaniards as common land upon which was raised the produce fortown consumption The town once stood204 here beside the Mississippi butas the bank began to crumble away they removed farther inland Aboutthirty miles in the interior are the celebrated iron mountains formedof micaceous iron ore The pilot knob is three hundred and one feethigh with a base of a mile in circumference The iron occurs here inmasses of several tons weight The other hill is three hundred and fiftyfeet high both ores yielding eighty per cent Near the town is a quarryof fine white marble and a deposit of dazzling white sand which is sentto Pittsburgh and sold to the glass factories This is one of the portsfrom which the iron and lead is shipped Kaskaskia is another French town nearly opposite this place but beingbuilt four miles up the Kaskaskia river we could only see its landingIt was settled by La Salle in 1683 and was supported by the Indian furtrade and afterwards by flour exporting in 1746 eight hundred weightto New Orleans There is here a catholic nunnery The Kaskaskia river isa fine stream which runs into the Mississippi a short distance aboveSt Genevieve upon the Illinois shore It is four hundred miles longbut navigable not quite a hundred owing to obstructions which couldwith small expense be cleared away Some of the best land in the Stateis upon its banks Chester is a small town a few miles beyond it seated at the foot of ahigh range of cliffs Although small in appearance it carries on a brisktrade its exports by steamboat being in 1836 one hundred and fiftythousand dollars Among other manufactories is one for making castoroil Near this is fort Chartres built by the French in 1720 to defendthemselves205 against the Spaniards It was a fine specimen of the styleof Vaubon and built in the most solid manner but now lies in ruinshaving large trees growing upon its prostrate walls At the mouth of Big Muddy river forty miles below Kaskaskia we stoppedto take in wood and we went on shore to take an evening stroll TheFrench named this stream riviere au vase from a vase of earthen warediscovered upon its banks There is much good coal upon its shores Wewandered through the ‘the forest’s leafy labyrinth’ wondering at thegreat size and luxuriant foliage of the trees The locust here grows tothe height of eighty or ninety feet the beeches oaks and sycamoresare enormous The parsimon grows larger here than with us We alsoobserved the Chickasaw plum the pawpaw and cotton tree We seatedourselves upon the bank of the river and looked upon it with wonder asit came rushing wildly past much like a stream which has just plungedover some high ledge of rocks Upon its bosom it bears a forest oftrees some old and waterworn shorn of their honors and some tornaway in all the glory and beauty of their youth The water comes withsuch velocity that it tears away the earth from one side of the rivercarrying it to the other thus constantly changing the shape of theshores and varies its channel so that the navigator is often puzzled tofind his course I am glad I have looked upon the Mississippi To read of it and to seeit are two different things All these wondrous works of the Creatorgive us clearer ideas of his power and his goodness It is indeed anextraordinary sight—a river over three thousand miles206 long and from amile to one and a half miles wide traversing eighteen degrees oflatitude through various climates from the arctic to the equator over‘more degrees of latitude than any other river in the world’ Somewriters call this river the Miss Sipi ‘father of waters’ while otherstell us its name is Namæsi Sipu Tish river It flows from Itasca lakea transparent cool reservoir of water fifteen hundred feet above thegulf of Mexico a clear beautiful stream plunges over the falls of StAnthony and then a broad river one mile and a half wide it sweeps inlong regular bends through a wide valley adorned with varied sceneryuntil it enters the gulf of Mexico Sometimes it is lined with bluffsfrom one hundred to four hundred feet high or a soft green prairiesloping banks impenetrable marshes large cities and pretty villagesThe clay which the Missouri brings with it is heaped upon the shores orin a pile at the bottom of the river upon which a snag a long trunk ofa tree is flung which standing upright pierces the bottoms ofvessels or as a sawyer rises and falls to strike the unfortunate barkwhich happens to pass over it The danger from these is however muchdiminished by the ingenuity of Captain Henry M Shreve who hascontrived a machine worked by steam by means of which when the wateris low he raises the snags and sawyers from the river We were told hethis year extracted fifteen hundred besides tearing away from the banksmany thousands which were ‘topling to a fall’ It seems a hopeless taskto pull away the hanging trees from the wooded shores of a river threethousand one hundred and sixty miles long whose banks are constantlyunder207mined by the waters besides the Ohio which runs twelve hundredmiles and when these are cleared the mad Missouri coming down overthree thousand miles through a forest clad country continually sendsdown fresh victims which it has wrenched from their homes to consign inall the ‘pride of life’ to destruction As if not content with themischief the Mississippi sometimes takes a fancy to make a cut offinstead of following the curve or bend which it has made into thecountry for perhaps twenty miles it dashes with fury against the earthin front until it cuts its way through and reaches its former channeltearing away with it houses lands and whatever had stood in its pathThis malicious conduct the Indians impute to its enmity to the whiteman and fills up its channel plants snags and sawyers to vex and towreck him The earthquake in the year 1811 the year in which Fultonlaunched the first boat upon the western waters they say was caused bytheir Manitou to frighten the white man away from his country Theearthquake was felt in many places slightly but at New Madrid upon theMississippi it was very severe Houses and chimneys were thrown downland raised for some distance down the river and in many places itcracked apart vomiting up fire and red hot sand Lakes were formed ofmiles in length which still remain The introduction of steam is fastconquering all obstacles Before its introduction three or four monthswere employed in voyages where now it is done in so many weeks Theflatboat floated upon the tide or pushed along with poles and when apoint was to be cleared the crew landed and fastening ropes to thetrees drew their bark along this process208 was called cordellingThere are now upon these waters four hundred and thirtysevensteamboats from thirty to seven hundred and eightyfive tons besidesflat and keel boats but no sloops or sail boats except an occasionalsail put up by the keel boats These boats are very different from thoseused upon our eastern waters Our cabins and saloon you know are uponthe same deck with the machinery and dining rooms below while above isa fine long promenade deck When you enter one of these boats you stepupon the lowest deck having the machinery in the centre while the endsare covered with freight or deck passengers who cannot pay the cabinfare Ascending a stairway you find yourself upon the guards a walkextending all around the boat like a narrow piazza from which severaldoors open into the rooms The whole deck here is thrown into threeapartments the ladies cabin at the stern having staterooms around itopening upon the deck or into the cabin from this folding doors leadinto the diningroom surrounded with gentlemen’s berths beyond is thebarroom from which you pass into an open space where around two smokepipes the male passengers assemble to smoke and chat The ladies cabinis handsomely furnished with every convenience and in some instanceswith a piano Above this is yet another deck called the hurricane deckThis is the best situation for viewing the scenery were it not for thesteampipe which as these are high pressure boats sends out the steamwith a loud burst like a person short of breath July 16th—I arose with the dawn to obtain a peep209 at the junctionof the Ohio with the Mississippi We turned from the wide Mississippiand its turbid waters into the glassy Ohio around a point of land uponwhich is built the town of Cairo The land is low here and subject toinundations but it is expected the art of man will overcome this andCairo at the junction of these two great rivers will become a largecity The central railroad is to commence here which will crossIllinois to Galena from thence to the Mississippi river a distance offour hundred and fiftyseven and a half miles There are several othertowns upon and near this point as America Unity Trinity and Fultonwhere a statue to the great steamboat projector will be erected Alittle farther on is another village called Caledonia Our passengers consist of a party of fashionables on a jaunt ofpleasure to the Sulphur Springs of Virginia some travelling merchantsand several persons visiting the towns upon the river A state room wasobserved to be constantly closed and a young man about twenty whooccasionally came from it squeezed himself in as if afraid hiscompanion would be seen from without The curiosity of the young ladieswas soon excited and by means of the chambermaid they ascertained itwas the young man’s wife a young girl apparently about fourteen whowas thus carefully secluded A runaway match was immediately whisperedabout the young people became quite in a fever to obtain a glimpse ofthe fair heroine It was a long time ere their wish was gratified asshe never left her room taking even her meals there Our mornings onboard are generally very social the ladies sitting with the gentlemenof their party upon the guards or gath210ering in groups with their workwhile the male passengers are smoking talking politics or gamblingThe negro banjo and merry laugh or joke of some son of Erin echoesup from the lower deck but in the afternoon the siesta is the fashionand every one turns in his berth to take a nap I did not follow thiscustom as I was unwilling to lose any of the scenery so that I usuallystole out of my state room like a mouse from its hole and after a longlook up and down the river stole in again the heat being too great toallow of a long stay Yesterday afternoon oppressed with thirst andwith heat for the thermometer on board stood at ninetysix I went intothe ladies’ cabin in search of water a jar of which filled with lumpsof ice was placed upon a marble table in one corner of the cabin Theladies were all in their berths except two who were using every ‘meansand appliance’ to keep themselves cool They were each in a rockingchair kept in motion their feet upon an ottoman made a table for theirbooks while a large feather fan in one hand and a lump of ice inanother were tolerable arms against the fire king Miss Martineauexpatiates upon the indifference of our females to the scenery ofnature and I dare say she would place these two upon her list of niladmirari ladies but travellers are very apt to look upon the surface ofthings these ladies and indeed almost all we meet in steamboats havebeen so often over the scene that they know it by heart and need notbrave heat and storms to see it as a stranger would Our people are arestless body and men women and children are always upon the move Asthirsty as I was I hesitated to drink the thick muddy water for while211standing in our tumblers a sediment is precipitated of half an inch Ohhow I longed for a draught of cool spring water or a lump of Rocklandlake ice While drinking one of the ladies advanced for the samepurpose ‘Dear me what insipid water’ she said ‘it has been standingtoo long I like it right thick’ I looked at her in surprise ‘Do youprefer it muddy to clear’ I asked ‘Certainly I do’ she replied ‘Ilike the sweet clayey taste and when it settles it is insipid HereJuno’ calling to the black chambermaid who was busy ironing ‘get mesome water fresh out of the river with the true Mississippi relish’Every one’s back is indeed fitted to his burden This person had livedupon the banks of the Mississippi had drank its waters all her daysand now it required to be muddy ere it was palateable The chambermaiddescended to the lower deck where a gallant black beau drew a bucketfrom the river and after satisfying the lady she resumed her ironingAgainst this practice of ironing in the ladies cabin I must uplift myvoice I suffered from this annoyance upon the Illinois Mississippi andOhio Constantly there was a woman washing upon the lower deck wherethe water thrown from the wheel falls upon the deck in a prettycascade and another is ironing above All the ironing of the boat andcrew and often of the passengers is done in the ladies small sittingroom the steam and perfume of the wet clothes charcoal furnace and ofthe ironer is extremely disagreeable In one instance I knew this to bethe case all night the girls taking it by turns and I never travelledone day without this addition to the heat and other discomforts of asteamboat In such long voyages it212 may be necessary to wash for thecaptain and crew but surely bed and table linen enough might beprovided to reach Cincinnati where they stop long enough to have themwashed If not why may there not be a room in some other part of thedeck The captain in some instances reaps the profits as thechambermaids are his by hire or purchase and if they charge all as theydid us one dollar and fifty cents a dozen the profit must beconsiderable It is sometimes as in our case a great convenience totravellers but another place should be provided But to go on with myafternoon adventures I left the cabin and walked out upon the shadyside of the guards All was still except the booming steampipe everyone was asleep or reading I leaned over the railing and found the banjoplayer and his audience all in slumbering attitudes or swinging intheir hammocks and every thing denoted silence and repose Suddenly aterrific and astounding bang clang and clatter as if the boat had beencracked to atoms the wheel house was broken in pieces the boards flewover me and a torrent of water flowing from it nearly washed me fromthe deck In a moment every one tumbled out and rushed upon the deckexclaiming ‘what’s the matter’ ‘are we snagged’—‘has the boilerburst’—‘is it a sawyer’ The old Kentucky lady who had stepped outfirst took her pipe from her mouth and said quietly ‘It’s only a log’‘Oh only a log’ ‘nothing but a log’ echoed from every mouth andreturning to their cabins they all stepped into their berths again Ilooked around me in amazement ‘Only a log’ said I to myself and whatis a log The steamboat is broken and stops all is confusion and crashand I am told it is noth213ing but a log ‘Madam’ said I turning to theKentucky woman ‘will you have the goodness to tell me what a log is’‘There they are’ she said pointing with her pipe to the riverFloating along like so many alligators were long branchless trunkswhich had been wafted along thousands of miles from the Rocky Mountainsperhaps ‘But pardon me madam how are these logs able to create such adisturbance’ ‘You seem a stranger child’ she replied ‘as these arefloating along and we are riding among them what more natural thanthat they should get in the water wheel break it and stop the boatBut see the carpenters are already at work and I dare say they willhave it repaired in the course of two or three hours’ So saying sheknocked the ashes out of her pipe took off her cap and passed into herstate room to sleep away the hours we were doomed to pass under a Julysouthern sun inactive The most remarkable event connected with thisaccident was the discovery of the fair unknown of the closedstateroom When the noise was first heard the young man rushed outbearing a plump rosy young girl in his arms who as soon as he put herdown began to tell the beads of a long rosary which hung from her neckOne glance sufficed to tell him the nature of the accident and he lefther to walk towards the wheel house just as the Kentucky ladydisappeared Seeing the poor thing’s agitation I turned towards her andendeavored to sooth her ‘I thank the Virgin Mary it is no worse’ shesaid kissing her cross ‘but something dreadful will come to punish mywickedness Oh how could I leave my dear mother Abbess and the sisters’Stopping sud214denly she gazed around her in affright for she hadunconsciously said more than she intended ‘Oh dear what am I saying’she exclaimed ‘where is Edward why did he leave me’ I soon succeededin soothing her and when I related my conversation with the old womanshe laughed merrily at my ignorance Her young husband returned and wasso delighted to see her cheerful that he immediately drew chairs weall sat down and were soon as social as old friends I was much amusedwith the surprise of my companion who had come in search of me when hesaw me upon such familiar terms with this mysterious couple The littlecreature seemed delighted to escape from her confined quarters andrelished a little chat so much that she this morning came to my roomand sat some time with me We passed this morning several islands oneof them containing ten thousand acres which with the rocky shores ofIllinois make the scenery very pleasing Paducah upon the Kentuckyside at the mouth of the Tennessee is a small town seemingly solidlybuilt of brick but chiefly interesting from the romantic story attachedto it It takes its name from an Indian heroine who was here sacrificedin revenge by a party of Pawnees Fort Massac is a few miles below itwhich was taken from the French by an Indian stratagem The Indiansdressed in bear skins made their appearance in the vicinity of thefort which enticed the Frenchmen out for a chase when another bandrushed into the fort and took it All were massacred From thence to themouth of the Cumberland river the shores seem uncultivated as thesettlements are back from the river but we were compensated by aglorious show of215 trees vines and foliage of every hue The sycamorehere grows to enormous height sixty or seventy feet full of branchesthese great branches stretch up eighty feet higher and spread out allaround it The white of its trunk and limbs has a very pretty effectamong the green forests The white maple is also a beautiful ornament tothe groves its leaves being a bright green but every breeze stirringamong them displays the brilliant white lining Its trunk is silveryhue Upon the Kentucky side of the river we have the pretty yellow locustthe hackberry with its dark foliage the mulberry juneberry with itsred fruit and leaves lined with silvery down and above all the talland graceful cotton wood tree popular angulati whose bright greenfoliage is very beautiful in contrast The groves of this tree are veryornamental to a landscape Among these trees upon both shores weobserved the brilliant bignonia radicans or Virginia creeper whichmounted to the tops of the highest trees and swinging down arrangeditself in graceful festoons adorned with its pretty scarlet trumpetshaped flowers The river is more placid than our last but is not yetfree from the defilement of the Mississippi and takes a yellowishtinge Golconda we passed about twelve o’clock upon the Illinois sidea small town remarkable for nothing but its fiery red brick courthouse with a cupola There is a small settlement at the mouth of theCumberland river before which was a row of steamboats which were inwaiting for the rise of the river to ascend to Nashville in Kentuckywhich lies upon this river Illinois as if wishing to leave a goodimpression upon us at parting rises in masses of limestone presentingevery216 variety of scene overhanging cliffs promontory walls andcastellated appearances being the foundation of the State for at thesummit the ground continues in a plain to the lakes Sometimes ourcourse lay so near these rocks that we could distinguish the flowersspring from the crevices and the chrystal rills which jumped from rockto rock This destroyed the illusion of towers and turrets but we werecompensated by being able to examine the limestone which presentedvarious shades from the yellow clay marl to the compact and bluelimestone and light solite A large cave runs under these rocks themouth of which is surrounded by a grove of graceful cypresses whichtree we have observed occasionally upon the shore before and afterthis The mouth of the cave is an arch about thirty feet high This cavehas in the time of the flat boats been a sort of tavern where the crewand passengers have waited sometimes for days in a storm It was oncealso a robbers’ haunt Many persons anxious to descend to posterityhave cut their names upon the rock and taken from the wildness andseclusion of the scene by large black letters but I shall not ministerto their ambition by writing their names Shawnee town is a place ofconsiderable importance in the southern part of Illinois It stands upona plain elevated from the river with a back ground of bluffs andseems a considerable place The situation is most beautiful and itmakes a pretty picture from the river A band of Indians of the Shawneetribe once lived upon this spot but at the approach of the white menretired to the western plains beyond the Mississippi At Shawnee towncommences the great saliferous formation which ex217tends through thevalley of the Ohio to its head waters and spreads away upon each sidethrough Ohio and Kentucky and along the Alleghany mountains The strataof this formation consists of sandstone limestone coal argillaceousrocks and slate stones but the peculiar rock from which the salt wateris drawn is a white calcareous sand rock full of cells and vacantplaces once containing salt There is also an upper layer of white sandrock from which a small quantity is produced23 To procure this theboring is sometimes carried very deep several hundred feet as thestrata generally lie below tide water in this valley and some wellsare sunk three hundred feet below the present surface of the oceanWhere they strike the flint rock strata it is very tedious the workmennot being able to bore more than two or three inches in twentyfourhours Carburetted Hydrogen gas rises in almost every place where thesalt is found and wells are often sunk from this evidence aloneSometimes the gas comes up with such violence as to drive out the boringmachine or flows with the water and again rushes up in suddenexplosions at intervals of hours or days springing up in the air to aheight of a hundred feet This gas easily takes fire Petroleom is alsofound accompanying the salt and is used by the inhabitants for bruisesor to oil machinery Filtered through charcoal it is burned in lampsIn the country upon the Muskingum river are several deposites of saltrock or Muriatiferous rock In Hockhocking valley salt is reached byboring to the depth of five hundred and fifty feet and218 at anotherplace eight hundred feet Here the water is very pure and strongaveraging fifteen per cent of muriate of soda and runs in a constantstream of twelve thousand gallons in twentyfour hours Salt is alsofound in the Monongahela valley Upon the Kiskiminitas river fivehundred thousand bushels are exported annually it is found upon theGuyandot and in the northeastern parts of Kentucky but the mostextensive salines are upon the Kenawa river where the strata occupy anextent of twelve or fourteen miles upon the river Fifty gallons ofwater yield fifty pounds of salt of fine quality In some places coarsesalt and in others fine table salt is made This necessary article wasfirst discovered by the animals who seem to be very fond of it Themastodon elk buffalo and other animals were in the habit of resortingfor it to certain places which retain the name of Lick as Buffalo LickBig Bone Lick etc At the lick upon the Kenawha the paths worn bythese animals are still visible For many years salt was brought to thewestern valley with great labor over the Alleghany mountains upon thebacks of horses and sold for two or three dollars a pound Now it canbe procured at the salines for half a cent Around the salines arefragments of broken pottery and other Indian articles showing theaborigines were in the habit of digging for it Upon Salt creek nearShawneetown is a very ancient salt work which was once resorted to bythe Indians Vessels of earthenware bearing the impression of a basketare found there and one which was evidently used for evaporation islarge enough to contain sixteen gallons This great deposite of saltseems to be inexhaustible for twentyfour219 years it has beenmanufactured at Kenawha and in these last years one million of bushelsa year and the supply has not diminished Two hundred bushels are madea day The process used is to convert the water by heat to brine andafterwards evaporized Ten miles below Shawneetown we pass the mouth of the Wabash theboundary line between Illinois and Indiana a beautiful stream runningsix hundred miles through Indiana Upon the shores of the Ohio near itare groves of the Pecaun tree carya olivæfornis It is a beautifulstraight tree bearing a very pleasant nut Pecaun according toSchoolcraft is the Chippeway word for nut At sun down we stopped totake in wood and to procure milk As it was rather damp I did not landbut was much amused with the antics of men and boys who delighted tohave space frolicked and jumped about the woods The southerners intheir thin pink and purple or blue striped coats added to the gaiety ofthe scene Our steward with his tin kettle entered a small cottage orrather log cabin near and procured a supply of fresh milk which wesaw a young country lass draw from their cow she had just driven homeWhile our husbands strolled together my little catholic confided to meher history after the fashion of travelling heroines you know She wasthe daughter of a wealthy planter in Kentucky who although of thepresbyterian faith had sent his child to a catholic nunnery to beeducated She had as is very common in such cases become a convert tothe catholic faith and when her parents came to carry her homedeclared it her intention to take the veil and never leave her conventHer parents intreaties and despair were of no use stay she220 would anddid A convent however was not to be her destiny for she fell in lovewith a young gentleman brother of a friend of her’s at the sameconvent who often came there to see his sister The attachment beingmutual they had with the assistance of the sister contrived to elopeThey were now on their way to New York and she was so fearful of beingrecognized and brought back that she would not at first leave herstateroom ‘Were you not sorry to leave your mother’ I asked her ‘Ohdear yes she and the sisters were always so kind to me’ ‘I mean yourmother and your father not the mother abbess’ ‘Alas my parents aresuch sad heretics that I ought not to love them I shall never see themin the next world and it is better to be separated here’ I was shockedat her answer but thought the parents were well punished for theculpable step they had taken in placing their child where she was likelyto embrace a religion different from their own I wish to say nothingagainst the catholic religion but if parents are unwilling theirchildren should imbibe its tenets they certainly do wrong to place themwhere they are taught It is a custom too common in the west and southand this is not the first instance I have known of division betweenparents and children in consequence July 17th—We are now sailing along the coast of Indiana having bidadieu to the beautiful State of Illinois after having travelled throughit and along its coast over eight hundred miles This State seems to beendowed by nature with every requisite for the comfort or enjoyment oflife It is three hundred and221 eighty miles long and two hundred andtwenty broad Upon three sides it is bounded by the Mississippi Ohioand Wabash and upon the fourth by the great lakes it is crossed bystreams canals and roads and thus is enabled to send its produce inany direction The soil which covers it is of inexhaustible fertilitycapable of producing the richest fruits grains and vegetables coveredwith woodland and prairie and abounding with coal metals andquarries It presents a level plain inclining gently to theMississippi consisting of thirtyseven million nine hundred andfiftytwo thousand acres24 The prairie land occupies two thirds ofthe State the rest is wooded or bottom land These prairies were oncecovered with herds of buffalo wolves and panthers all now except afew wolves are far away over the Mississippi These grassy pastures arevaluable for cattle and the soil is easily tilled and produces treeswhere the fire is kept off All sorts of grain neat cattle swinehorses tobacco cotton and sugar are raised with ease The amount ofthe productions of this State according to the tabular statement drawnup by the United States Marshall H Wilton Esq is fiftyone millionfour hundred and eleven thousand six hundred and six dollars Take thisaccount and the number of its population four hundred and twentythreethousand nine hundred and thirtyfour and then turn to the state of thecountry only twenty years since when it was the home of Indian tribeswith a few white men scattered over it and you will obtain some idea ofthe sudden increase of the west The want of timber and water as pine is scarce in222 Illinois and uponthe prairie there is but little of any kind has prevented thesettlement of the prairies It is the opinion of all whom I heard speakupon the subject they were the most eligible places of settlement aswater can be procured at the depth of fifteen or twenty feet and timbereasily brought over the smooth plains in wagons while cutting downforests to clear the land is toilsome and expensive The centre of theprairies is always higher than the skirts which if it renders them drymakes them more healthy places of residence than the dank humid groundof a forest The tobacco beef and wheat of Illinois are superior tothat of the neighboring States and finds a ready sale in the marketthe latter weighing sixtyeight pounds to a bushel25 Very good wineis made there from the sweet grapes which abound in every part of theState Coal is found in abundance every where and will be constantlydiscovered iron and copper occur in some places while the lead minesof this State Wisconsin and Missouri yield more than the whole ofEurope including England It is generally a foliated glitteringsulphuret found in cubical crystals yielding fifty per cent in logfurnaces and sixteen more after further process The masses occur inclay and veins in the rocks This rich mineral was so near the surfacethat the Indians frequently dug it up and men in want of money were inthe habit of procuring it sure of a ready sale at St Louis The peopleof Illinois obtained their nickname of suckers from the practice ofgoing up the Mississippi when the spring opened for lead which was theperiod of the annual voyage up the river of the Succar fish223Thirtythree million lbs was produced in all the lead region lastyear The scenery of the mineral region is very beautiful and is wateredby the Mississippi Wisconsin and other rivers The interests ofreligion and education are not neglected the State has laid aside inlands and money three millions for the latter object Colleges arebeing erected churches are building and every thing for the comfortand refinement of life is here in progress So if you have a mind toemigrate come to Illinois We have today passed several villages uponeach side of the river possessing little of interest to write youexcept Hoarsville upon the Kentucky shore where we stopped a littlewhile There is a coal mine in its vicinity The Indiana shore presentsan elevated bank upon which we continually saw farms and cottages butthe opposite shore is low and subject to inundation which gives it alonely appearance Both sides however are adorned with beautiful treesHere beside giant beech walnut and various oaks were the pretty redbud cercis canadensis the Ulmus Americana red maple sassafrascornus florida upon the Kentucky bank besides extensive groves ofcotton wood were the basswood or American lime with its yellowtassels the gum American nettle with its red berries June berry andan endless variety of others beautiful and rare Fairy isles areoccasionally passed covered with pretty shrubs and flowers and fringedwith the soft bushy willow called here tow Indiana shows many prettyvillages embowered among her trees or scattered along her slopingbanks and we have today passed Troy Evansville Rockport RomeFredonia Manchport while the other224 side Westport is quite aconspicuous and pleasing town situated upon a high bluff its housesperched like eagles nests upon the high points of the cliff while thebrick courthouse stands upon the bank beneath The river upon bothsides had for many miles back presented a succession of these bluffswild and rugged but after leaving Rockport the rocks become more likeregular hills rising gradually to a high summit cone shaped coveredwith lofty trees and a carpet of verdure We here saw that singularfeature of Ohio shore scenery the hills upon one shore faced with alevel plain upon the opposite shore Each shore presents a succession ofhill and valley the hills on one side being opposed to the valley ofthe other As if while the river ran from east to west the stratacrossed it N E and S W a rupture in these would leave room for theriver This agrees with the theory of our Alton friend that thelocation and course of this river was caused by a rupture in the coalmeasures The boys upon the Ohio have imitated the Illinois ducks intheir pastime of which I wrote you when our boat has passed they pushoff the shore into the agitated water of our wake and seem to take muchpleasure in bobbing up and down We sailed under cliffs this afternoonof rough rugged jagged limestone with precipices and romantic dellsquite sufficient to satisfy a whole boarding school of romantic missesThe setting sun cast his shadows far over the river leaving us inshade while far above the trees which fringed the cliffs were paintedwith gold A ray piercing through a vista in the rocks fell upon thewindows of the pretty town of Evansville tipping its spires withburnished gold lighting225 up the windows as if each house kept highfestival Tint after tint of all this glory has faded and see theriver is white with mist now rising high above the trees After theintense heat of the day this strikes you with a chill and they who knowits fatal effects hasten within—reluctantly I follow them and bid yougood night July 18th—We are now approaching the falls of the Ohio which arerapids caused by a ledge of blue limestone rocks which here cross theriver and impede the navigation except in very high water To avoidthis a canal is cut across the bend of the river two and a half milesin length to Louisville This canal is excavated out of the compactlimestone and the cut is in some places ten feet deep There are fourlocks The amount of tolls received here from eighteen hundred andthirtyone to eighteen hundred and thirtyseven was according to JudgeHall four hundred and seventyfive thousand twentyfive dollars andfourteen cents and he gives a list of four hundred and seventeensteamboats which passed through the canal during the year eighteenhundred and thirty seven There is a small place called Shipping Port at the mouth of the canalwhere we observed several handsome carriages in waiting for those whothus preferred it to the slower operation of ascending twentytwo feetof lockage Here were several steamboats moored As we entered thesecond lock the North Star a fine boat of one hundred and fortyeighttons came dashing into the lock we had left and when we had bothascended the Maine which we had passed upon the226 river yesterdayentered the first lock so that we had the novel spectacle of threelarge steamboats filled with merchandize and passengers all at onetime rising and falling in several locks The locks are large enough forfirst class boats and the whole of the canal is finished in the mostsolid and beautiful manner It is fifty feet wide at surface No horsesare used we passed through by steam The strata cut through at thecanal presented 1st friable slate three inches five feet of fetidlimestone containing petrifactions water lime blue limestone compactgrey limestone with nodules of quartz and limestone The water lime wasused by the workmen Cedar trees were dug up human bones and fireplaces When we had left the canal we beheld before us the slopingbank covered with houses manufactories churches c This wasLouisville the capital of Kentucky seated upon a gradually risingbank commanding a fine view of the river and the Indiana shoreopposite We landed and as we had but two hours to remain here weimmediately entered a coach and directed the man to drive us throughall the streets past every remarkable building and in fact show us allthe lions My head was out the window a dozen times calling ‘Driverwhat building is that’ The streets are wide and straight containingmany handsome buildings Main street is the principal business streetand is lined with rows of shops upon each side for it seemed to me amile and in the suburbs iron and cotton factories steam mills cThe private houses are handsome and some of the new ones built of thenative limestone threaten to rival any in the State The hotels seemedcalculated to accommodate a large number of227 travellers The court housewhich is now building is very large and when finished will be quite anornament to the city It is an oolite limestone found in Indiana Wepassed a high school seminary twelve churches a theatre threemarkets and a large building with wings having a portico in frontsupported with marble columns which is we were told the MarineHospital This city carries on a brisk trade There are twentyfivesteamboats over a hundred tons burthen which ply between this port andCincinnati and New Orleans Louisville is five hundred and thirtyfourmiles from St Louis and we have one hundred and thirtytwo more to goto Cincinnati If we are to believe one of their papers the cause ofeducation flourishes as there has been published this year by onefirm one hundred and thirteen thousand volumes of school books theyhaving in these and other works expended sixteen thousand dollars worthof paper Our driver stopped at the gate of a public garden which hesaid was a fashionable resort We peeped in but were more anxious tobehold works of art than nature and soon reentered the carriage andfinding our time expired returned to the vessel Here we were obligedto wait some time and in the meanwhile amused ourselves in examiningthe shore Corn Island with the rapids glittering in the morning sunwas upon one side and upon the other the town of Jeffersonville issituated upon an elevated bank on the Indiana shore The buildings arevery showy being of red brick and some of them pretty Steam ferryboats are constantly passing between this place and Louisville CornIsland is said by the Indians to have been the last stand of the lastof the mound build228ers who they say were driven away from the countryby their ancestors I forgot to mention New Albany which we passed afew miles beyond Louisville It is a considerable place doing muchbusiness and having several churches lyceum schools and other publicinstitutions The heat drove me into the ladies’ cabin which beingempty I sat down to put down a few notes I had scarcely seated myselfwhen the young catholic runaway I mentioned before rushed in andthrowing herself beside me hid her head in my lap exclaiming ‘Oh theyare here my mother my father they will separate me from Edwardforever’ I looked towards the door with much anxiety for I had heardthe southern planters were a gouging raw head and bloody bones sort ofpeople who whipped a slave to death once a week and I feared for thefate of the poor young wife My information however had been taken fromforeign tourists and I found this idea like many others I had imbibedfrom them was far from truth Imagine my surprise when a pleasantgood humored looking man entered the room and seating himself in achair gave way to a hearty fit of laughter His wife a tall slenderladylike looking personage walked directly up to her daughter andfolded her in her arms while gentle tears flowed over her cheeks Ilooked at the father in perplexity wondering at his extraordinarymerriment and at Edward who stood beside him having I thought a mostunbecoming smirk upon his countenance The lady looked up to her husbandreproachfully but said nothing ‘My dear madam’ he said at last to me‘I understand you have taken a kind interest in my little girl’sconcerns and I owe it to you229 to explain the circumstances of the caseAnxious to give my daughter the best of education I sent her to aconvent not far from my estate where there were some very accomplishedladies from Europe who could teach her all I wished her to know Butwhen I went to take her home my lady fancied herself a catholic andrenounced her home and friends forever I returned home in despair andwhile revolving my future proceedings in this disagreeable affairEdward the son of a dear friend who several years since had removed toNew York came to make us a visit In telling him my difficulties Iadded how glad I should have been had this not occurred to give herand my plantation to him ‘I will scale the convent and carry her off’he said in a jest The idea struck me as a good one I pressed it uponhim and you see here they are and have my hearty blessing’ The brideas her father spoke had gradually dried her tears and raised her heada little When she began to understand the denouement she first blusheddeeply with mortification then pouted and at last burst suddenly intoa merry laugh and ran like a fawn into her father’s outspread armsexclaiming ‘Oh you naughty papa you good for nothing papa’ The partysoon after departed and I received kind expressions and adieus fromall and a few tears from the bride All pressed us to visit them andthe father said if we would only come to Big Bloody Bone Buffalo Lickhe would show us the finest blue grass fields best corn and tobaccoand heartiest negroes in all old Kentuck And if I wanted a nice younggirl to wait upon me I should have the pick of all his slaves I wasquite delighted to meet with such a romantic adventure for I had beenlooking out230 for something as you must be very tired of hearing aboutnothing but trees and rivers and towns Pray do not think I made thisout of my fertile brain I assure you it is true After leaving Louisville the shores become more cultivated upon eachside than they have been Extensive cornfields in Indiana show theyare as great ‘corncrackers’ as their neighbors The houses are betterbuilt and always of brick or limestone as pine is scarce upon theOhio The Kentucky river empties into the Ohio about sixty miles aboveLouisville it is a beautiful stream coming down from the Cumberlandmountain running through high limestone cliffs and a rich countrycontaining salt coal and iron in abundance It is three hundred andtwentyfive miles long and upon it stands Frankfort At its mouth is atown called Port William a small place Kentucky shore now becomesmore cultivated and its blue grass fields nod in concert to the maize ofthe opposite side Nothing could be prettier than the Ohio as we sailedalong its ‘amber tide’ this day The yellow marl which occurs sofrequently along its banks gives it a yellowish tinge The river lookedas if it had been arranged by the hand of a landscape gardener soprettily combined was the grand and beautiful The trees are so many ofthem cultivated with us in our ornamented grounds that it takes fromthe wildness of the scene Here we saw the locust the horsechestnutthe willow tulip and column like cotton tree Among these the Virginiacreeper grape and other vines are clustering and swinging in thesummer breeze Springing from spray to spray was the mocking bird bluebird and brilliant green and231 red paroquet flashing in the midday sunAmong these are pretty towns farms and cottages—the whole having aback ground of jagged precipice or smooth swelling hills Madison uponthe Indiana shore is the place where we were to strike the Ohio if wehad journeyed through Indiana as we proposed at first A railroad leadsfrom this town to Indianapolis ninetyfive miles and is completed toVernon twentyfive miles From Indianapolis to La Fayette is aMcAdamized road and another railroad will soon be completed from thelatter place to lake Michigan That would have been our route and weshould have seen some of the best towns in Indiana Madison is a verypretty town and larger than any we had passed It is built principallyof brick and we counted six churches and a court house besides banksfounderies factories mills and boat yards The streets are wide andMcAdamized It is situated upon a sloping bank of the river whilebehind it the hills which rose up to nearly three hundred feet werecovered with farms dotted with sheep and cottages Some handsomemansions were erected among the hills in conspicuous situations and musthave commanded a fine view of the town beneath and the river windingaway through bluffs and forests in front of them The population isabout two thousand Madison is fiftythree miles from Louisville andtwenty miles farther is Vevay settled by a party of emigrants fromSwitzerland The river here stretches away to the north leaving a pointwhich is the county of Switzerland bathed upon two sides by the Ohioand containing very fertile soil Here the transplanted Swiss have madea new home and it is a very beauti232ful one occupying themselves inraising grapes Their vineyards are very flourishing and they make muchgood wine They cultivate the blue grape Madiera grape and the nativecounty grape which makes good wine The hills here no doubt oftenresound with the songs of their father land from which they are so manymiles distant As we approach the State of Ohio we feel as if we werereturning to a cultivated country for farms and dwellings of superiorstyle denoting wealth and prosperity occur frequently upon the shoresOne of them was quite elegant built of brick faced with marble andadorned with a portico in front of the same material Our setting sunis obscured by dark frowning clouds which threaten us with a storm Itcomes in whirling spray and wind which makes our stout bark rock underus and the terrific thunder outroars our groaning steampipe In thecourse of half an hour it was over but hundreds of lofty trees had beenswept from the banks and now were floating past us in all their leafyhonors A sudden stop in our boat’s speed sent us all out to ascertainthe cause I asked if it were another log but found the engine had metwith some breakage which would detain us a little while The steamboatwas laid by the shore and took this opportunity to get a supply ofwood As the evening was mild we left the boat for a stroll and to saywe had been in Indiana With some little effort we climbed the cliffsand when there found ourselves in front of a neat farm house surroundedby barns and orchards The passengers spread themselves about in everydirection and we were very much provoked to see some of them wantonlypulling off the young green apples and throwing233 them to the hogs foramusement I do not know what kind of consciences these people had—Iwould as soon have stolen the farmer’s pigs as his apples but I knowmen and boys are always rather lax in their morality towards appleorchards Prompted by a Yankee curiosity to see the inside of an Indianacottage I opened the gate and after passing through a small courtyardadorned with flowers we entered the open door and found ourselves in aneat apartment with comfortable carpets chairs etc This room openedagain upon a long piazza at the side of the house ornamented with a rowof clean bright churns and milk pans The farmer and his wife nowentered followed by a troop of children bearing pails loaded withfoaming rich milk They were surprised to find strangers in their houseand quite a crowd in front of it Soon understanding the case theykindly invited us to be seated and offered us a choice of new milk orhard cider They had emigrated here from New York State soon after theirmarriage and having hewed themselves a home in the forest hadgradually by industry and perseverance brought every thing around themto its present flourishing condition They seemed happy and healthyFrom their door there was a lovely view of the winding river and theplains of Kentucky opposite When we had descended to the shore weamused ourselves gathering specimens of the rocks They were a hard darkbrown limestone and appeared a mass of organic remains containingencrini terabratula and orthoceratites We searched the pebbles alongthe shore in hopes of finding some of the pretty silecious specimenswhich I had found upon the Illinois but succeeded however in pickingup234 only some small pieces of jasper and a few petrified shells At alittle distance a flat boat was drawn up to the shore and fastened to atree one of those long odd looking species of water craft which oncewas the only kind seen upon these rivers A man came from it and as hereached us bade us politely good evening and asked what we weresearching for Some persons would have found his conduct very improperand his question impertinent but I never mistake the frank kindindependent manner of my countrymen for impertinence We returned hissalute and informed him of the object of our search ‘You’ll findnothing here so pretty as is on the Mississippi and lake Superior I’vebeen pretty much over them regions and found some rale beauties—theyare called cornelions and red a’most as them what’s used as watchseals I found some geodes I think they call ’em also’ I said I hadheard of those and hoped some might have been washed down upon theseshores ‘My wife’s got some in the boat which she’ll show you ma’am ifyou walk there’ I looked up at the boat from whose windows severalfemale heads were taking observations and concluded to go there Wefollowed our new acquaintance into his ark which I found was his houseand shop he being a floating pedlar and had anchored or rather tiedhis ark to the rocks here to avoid the storm His boat was not thecommon flat boat but was of the species called keel boats andoccasionally carried a sail In addition to his sail he used oars andpoles to propel it with It was a rudely built affair just high enoughwithin for a man to stand but every thing was comfortably arranged Hiswife and his other woman were setting the supper table At235 his requestshe readily displayed her stores and would have pressed them upon me ifI would have taken them After we had returned to our boat we lookedtowards the shore and beheld the crew assembled for a jumping matchThey were a motly assemblage of firemen covered with soot pilotsstewards etc They formed a line—one of them placing himself in thecentre holding a stone in each hand swayed himself backward andforward and then sprang some jumping eighteen twenty and twentytwofeet with the greatest ease While crew and passengers were thusamusing themselves we were aroused by the cry of ‘The Ione is comingaway boys away’ and bounding over the shore they were soon in theboat We understood the meaning of this sudden cry and were much amusedwith the amazement and terror depicted in the countenances of those whodid not ‘What is coming’ they cried ‘Bears wolves sawyers what’It was soon all explained the Ione was in view which we had leftbehind us and it was feared it would arrive at Cincinnati before usThe hands were working with all their might the breakage was finishedthe paddle threw up a whirl of foam steam whizzed pipes snortedengineer’s bell tingled and away we went hurry skurry after ourrivals who had passed us with a triumphant cheer Straining every ropeand piece of machinery we soon shot ahead of the presumptuous Ioneringing our bell and shouting in our turn She was determined not to beout done and a regular race came on We ladies all determined we wouldnot go to bed but would remain up alarmed and uncomfortable one wentso far as to threaten to faint if the captain did not slacken hisspeed236 but we were laughed at by the gentlemen who enjoyed the sportHour after hour of the night passed away while we rushed swiftly throughthe waters with our foe just in our rear ‘Hurra fling on more wood’was the cry from below High blazed the furious fire illuminating thewater around the steam increased—the engine worked madly—the boatstrained and groaned at every stroke and seemed actually to spring outof the water Behind us came our rival puffing panting snortingthrowing out volumes of flame and sparks like some fiery dragon of oldand as she came near we could see into her lower deck where around thefierce fire shadowy forms were rushing bounding carrying woodheaping it on shouting and cursing One strain too much—one uprightsnag in our path and we should all be strewed some hundred souls uponthe water writhing agonizing dying—and all for what that we mightarrive one hour the sooner in the night at Cincinnati where we shouldbe obliged to lie still till morning or perhaps it was the honor ofbeating another boat—honor here setting the steam in motion as well asthe sword Our rival unable to compete with us abandoned the race andwas soon left behind our people satisfied with this wonderful triumphrelaxed in their speed the ladies recovered from their fears and oneby one crept into their berths We had here no such heroine as she whois going the rounds in the newspapers who in the excitement of therace finding the wood failing directed her smoked hams to be thrown onthe fire Sixteen miles below Cincinnati is the residence of Gen Harrison thecandidate for the Presidency It is said he lived in a log cabin but itwas a neat country237 dwelling which however I dimly saw by moonlightTo judge from what we have seen upon the road Gen H will carry allthe votes of the west for every one seemed enthusiastic in his favorLog cabins were erected in every town and a small one of wickerworkstood upon nearly all the steamboats At the woodyards along the riversit was very common to see a sign bearing the words ‘Harrison wood’‘whig wood’ or ‘Tippicanoe wood’ he having gained a battle at a placeof that name The western States indeed owe him a debt of gratitudefor he may be said to be the cause under Providence of theirflourishing condition He subdued the Indians laid the land out insections thus opening a door for settlers and in fact deserves thename given him of ‘Father of the west’ We have now passed another State Indiana along whose borders by thewinding of the river we have come three hundred and fifty miles fromthe Wabash river It is a fertile State like its surrounding sisterStates having but little hilly ground most of it being undulatingprairie It is crossed by several fine rivers has the Ohio for itssouthern and lake Michigan for its northern border It is two hundredand seventyfive miles long and one hundred and fortyfive broadcontaining thirtyeight thousand square miles Except the sand hills oflake Michigan and swamps of the Kankakee its soil is of inexhaustiblefertility Canals to the aggregate length of two hundred and thirtymiles have been completed or are in a state of forwardness andninetyfive of railroads Indianapolis is the capitol situated inMarion county upon the White river and in the centre of the StateThis county is a very fertile one having raised the238 last yearaccording to the marshal’s report nine hundred thousand bushels ofcorn sixtyseven thousand bushels of oats thirty thousand bushels ofwheat and twenty thousand head of hogs Indianapolis is only twentyyears old having been upon its site a dense forest in 1820 now ithas several public buildings churches schools courthouse etc andtwo thousand inhabitants The amount of tolls taken upon the canals andrailroads of Indiana amount to twentyeight thousand five hundreddollars Salt of a very fine kind is made in Fountain county Itspopulation is six hundred and eightythree thousand three hundred andfourteen At two o’clock at night we arrived at Cincinnati and took upour position at the end of a long line of steamers where we tried tosleep until morning239 Cincinnati July 19th My dear E—As much as we had heard of Cincinnati we were astonishedat its beauty and extent and of the solidity of its buildings It wellmerits the name bestowed upon it here—Queen of the west We haveexplored it thoroughly by riding and walking and pronounce it awonderful city The hotel to which we were recommended the BroadwayHouse was commodious and well conducted The family is a very agreeableone and well educated but remain in their own private apartmentsThere are numerous other hotels of all descriptions but none rival itunless it may be the new one called the Henri House Soon afterbreakfast we ordered a carriage which we found to be quite as handsomeas any we have in our city We spent the morning slowly driving up anddown each street along the Miami canal and in the environs of the cityin every direction and were quite astonished—not because we had neverseen larger and finer cities but that this should have arisen in what240was so lately a wilderness Its date you know is only thirty yearsback The rows of stores and warehouses the extensive and ornamentedprivate dwellings the thirty churches many of them very handsome andother public buildings excited our surprise Main street is theprincipal business mart While in the centre of this street we mark itfor a mile ascending the slope upon which the town is built and infront it seems interminable for the river being low we do not observewe are looking across it to the street of the opposite city ofCovington until a steamboat passing tells us where the city endsBroadway is another main artery of this city not however devoted tobusiness but bounded upon each side by rows of handsome dwellingsThird Fourth Seventh Vine and many other streets show privatehouses not surpassed by any city we had visited They are generallyextensive and surrounded by gardens and almost concealed from view ofthe passers by groves of shade trees and ornamental shrubbery Anaccidental opening among the trees shows you a glimpse of a piazza orpavillion where among groves and gardens the air may be enjoyed bythe children or ladies of the family We visited a museum in hopes of seeing some Indian relics or organicremains but found these curiosities had met with the fate of all thingsin America destruction by fire The owner of the museum had beennineteen years collecting it and it contained among other thingsbones of mastodon and mummies taken from a cave in Kentucky The lastwe were informed by the wife of the proprietor were in a sittingposture wrapped in mantles one having red hair241 the other black Shewas now doing her best to collect another museum Their house is a verynice one having three tiers of rooms and is rented to them for onethousand dollars ‘How did the fire originate’ I asked of the lady ofthe museum ‘Why ma’am’ said she ‘you must know the cellar of thishouse unbeknown to me was let out to a yellow barber who had somepowder for sale which blew up to our garret one day and set it on fireI heard the explosion but thought it one of the steamboats at thewharf——’ ‘Pardon me madam’ I said ‘but pray how many times a weekdo your steamboats blow up’ ‘Why I can’t exactly tell——’ ‘Oh wellgo on with your story’ ‘That day I came into this room before it wasburnt and says George says I to the man who is now playing on theorgan just as he was then George what is that which smells so muchlike burnt paint Why missus says he it is the back of this yerebench which was almost a coal afore I put it out Why George says Ihow did that happen Why the yaller barber’s stovepipe was so hotsays he it sot it afire I ran to the bench and found it had been sureenough burnt and the wall felt quite hot George what is thatcrackling noise says I Why it’s the yaller barber’s stovepipe what’sa cooling says he But I smelt smoke and I said to George George dorun up stars and see if there aint any fire anyhow He went but sooncame thumping down again making as much noise as if he had been a greatmastydone George says I what’s the matter Matter why gorry massamissus the roof’s burnt and fell on the garret floor and the garret242floor’s afire and fell on the third story floor—— Pshaw Georgeyou’re poking fun at me but just then up runs my husband as wild as aprairie wolf Wife Good God the roof is all afire he cried and ran upstairs when just as he reached the second flight the third floor felldown upon him and he was enveloped in flames He was dug out and youmay be sure he was a show burnt to a mummy his hat looking a bit ofcoke his dress hanging in scorched tatters and blind with smoke hestaggered about like a drunken nigger He was six weeks before herecovered from that burning’ ‘Indeed this fire has cost you muchsuffering’ ‘I have not told you all There is a young girl a distantrelation living with me to whom I am much attached she was up stairsheard a noise saw the fire and went to run down stairs when beholdthe stairs was away—burnt and fell down She ran about like a wildInjun trying to escape but could not and at last sank down at theplace where the stairs had been and expected to die Just at thatmoment as if sent by Providence some men from a flat boat ran up tohelp us ‘Why mother you’re in a bad fix anyhow’ said one ‘what isyour greatest treasure here and we will try to save that first’ Mygreatest treasure I said is a young girl whom I dearly love who isup stairs but I am afraid you cannot save her He ran along and lookedup when just then in a fit of despair she flung herself downthinking she might as well die so as she must die up stairs anyhow andhe being just under caught her She was very much bruised and her headis still much affected with heat and wounds’ I truly sympathized withthe unfortunate dillitante as the loss of a museum which one has beencollecting243 twenty years is a serious evil I think it behooves thecitizens of Cincinnati to encourage her endeavors to gather a newcollection by patronizing her museum From the upper balcony is a verybeautiful view of the opposite shores of Kentucky The two towns ofCovington and Newport line the bank with numerous buildings some ofthem very pretty while behind them arise a range of picturesque hillscovered with luxuriant herbage These two towns are separated by theriver Licking whose bright waters after flowing for two hundred milesthrough the fair plains of Kentucky enter the Ohio opposite CincinnatiBeneath us we looked down upon the wharf which was a scene of mixedgaiety and business A row of steamboats lay along the shore from andto which flowed a constant current of men and goods From some of thelargest the music of the band which they always carry sounded merrilywhile broad bright flags floated out upon the summer breeze Reentering our carriage we drove down to Fulton a town about twomiles from Cincinnati but which may be called a part of it as the roadis one long street leading to it containing iron founderies waterworks lumber yards c Omnibuses are constantly passing and repassingalong this street We observed here several large steamboats upon thestocks some of which were copper bottomed as a guard against snagsFulton looks pretty at a distance seated at the foot of a round softgreen hill After tea we passed through the city to the river alongwhose bank is a very pretty road This is the fashionable eveningdrive and we passed several carriages containing ladies and childrenand young persons on horseback244 enjoying the bland evening airAlthough the heat had been excessive during the day it was nowperfectly cool which is usually the case here Kentucky looked verylovely as the setting sun tinged its hill tops and threw a rosy hazeover its groves and fields and pretty cottages The broad river lookedplacid and lustrous as if rejoicing in the pretty reflections which layupon its surface A small fort opposite we were told was erected inhonor of the hero of Tippicanoe Gen Harrison who is much belovedhere and whom they expect to be the next President of the UnitedStates July 20th—I am happy to inform you the state of religion and moralsin this place are such as would please every lover of Jesus and of goodorder One fact speaks for itself there are here thirty churches Thereare also twelve public schools and between two and three thousandscholars who are there educated What a blessed thing is it to see acity instead of lavishing its surplus wealth upon theatres and placesof dissipation erecting schools and such respectable nay eleganthouses of public worship as we see in Cincinnati The consequences areseen in the circumstances and behaviour of the people Here is no hauntof vice no Faubourg St Antoine no five points the people keep theSabbath and are respectable and happy Sunday morning we attendedservice at Christ Church where we heard the beautiful episcopal serviceread by their pastor the Rev Mr Brooks who afterwards gave us a verygood discourse This is a very handsome church in the gothic formabounding in spires and abutments it is a grey brick edged with245 stoneThe interior is very elegant The pews are all lined and cushioned withblue while the pulpit and chancel and reading desk are a dazzlingmass of bronze and crimson and gold they are of bronze and giltGothic open work lined with crimson velvet Some antique chairs andbenches of oak carved lined and cushioned with velvet stand herewhile the whole is surrounded with a railing and kneeling cushion ofthe same material and lining The lamps and chandaliers are profuse andrich and the organ beautifully built of bronze In the same street isanother episcopal church called St Pauls which is in the Grecianstyle with a pediment in front supported by columns There are sixpresbyterian churches here some of which we visited and which arehandsome and well attended In the evening we went to the church of the Rev Mr Lynde a baptistclergyman whose church is in a very flourishing condition he havingbaptised five hundred new members last winter This chapel is in Ninthstreet and is a large brick building having a tall white spire Everything within is plain but neat The seats are in the sofa style edgedwith mahogany lined and cushioned with horse hair and having severalof them the owner’s name in brass plates upon the door as in some ofour churches The lamps and chandaliers as in the episcopal church aremore in number and richer than I have ever seen in our best churches Wewere quite pleased with Mr L His manner had a dignity and firmness asif thoroughly convinced of the truths he advanced and his address tohis people came with the power of one who spoke with authority Howpleasant it is to find this region246 which so lately resounded withsavage merriment or war cries now echoing the truth as it is in Jesus July 21st—We arose early and walked out to see the markets Thereare three well built The one on Broadway was filled with a profusionof meats fruits and vegetables which last were uncommonly fine Thestreets around the market were blocked up with wagons loaded withcountry produce During our rambles through the streets I was struck bythe sight of a building the oddest I ever beheld It was a huge uglything being a strange mixture of styles and an attempt at GothicTurkish and Moorish This was Mrs Trollop’s erection built for ahouse of pleasure and rooms were constructed for balls refreshmentand dressing rooms while below were to be shops These balls were to bein the style of Almacks quite exclusive It is now a ‘MechanicInstitute’ and when not using their rooms for the exhibitions let themout to lecturers exhibition of pictures or a fair The front is ofbrick adorned with Gothic arches and the roof surmounted with Gothicornaments A square tower rises from the back of the building having arow of brick pillars in front this contains a room having windows allaround on the top of this tower is another a round one having as Isaid a sort of moorish top We saw the time approach for leaving the‘Queen City’ with regret We left it in the steamboat Agnes a new andpretty boat but small ‘calculated to run any where it was moist’ asthe river is too low for the larger boats to ascend to Wheeling Theriver’s greatest rise here is sixtythree feet and it then runs with acurrent of six miles an hour247 When out in the river we looked sadlyback at Cincinnati which appears Queen like indeed while majesticallyreposing upon her throne of stately hills with the glorious river ather feet Cincinnati is built upon two plains which rise in gentleslopes from the river Fifty years ago fort Washington stood here andnow there is a large city of fortyfive thousand inhabitants containingchurches lyceums colleges and doing a business of six milliondollars There are a great many manufactories and forges and the steeland iron business is carried on to a considerable amount ‘fromponderous beam of steam engine cylenders and steam machinery tohousehold articles’ Its doings in the pork line you have heard ofseveral of the largest warehouses were pointed out to us as ‘porkwarehouses’ The Miami canal comes into the Ohio at Cincinnati thusbringing to it the produce from lake Erie The little Miami railroad isalso to terminate here A bend in the river and the ‘Queen of the West’is lost to our eyes The river scenery is very beautiful to day linedwith thriving farms dotted with pretty villas and towns having a background of those peculiar green hills which occur upon this river calledthe Ohio hills Among the towns we passed were New Richmond twentyonemiles from Cincinnati Moscow Mechanicsville Augusta c c Maysvilleis quite a large town in Kentucky which looked very gay as the sunsetting over the shadowy hills lighted up its scarlet brick houses andgave a brighter tint to the cotton wood groves with which they weresurrounded July 21st—When we left our stateroom we found248 ourselves nearPortsmouth the largest town we had seen since leaving Cincinnati It isseated upon a platform elevated above the river at the foot of a groupof pretty ‘Ohio hills’ Every one looked very busy here the shopsdisplayed a goodly show of merchandise two large hotels seemed full ofpeople drays were travelling about water carts were being filled inthe river and little boys and girls were hastening down to come onboard and sell their cakes and fruit I did not go on shore as we wereto stay only a short time but amused myself gazing about and eatingblack and whortleberries which the little buckeye girls sold for ‘a fipa quart’ This town is the southern termination of the Ohio canal whosenorthern outlet we had passed at Cleaveland upon lake Erie The Sciotoriver also enters the Ohio here It is a pretty stream 175 miles longIn the country through which it flows is much iron and forges andfounderies are established in many places around Portsmouth which is amarket for their produce The hills opposite this place are of a grandercharacter than any we had seen upon the Ohio and now with the lightsand shades of early summer morning upon them formed a charming picturefor the inhabitants of Portsmouth I remarked several pretty dwellingssurrounded by shrubbery which showed there were many here who were‘well to do in the world’ What delightful residences must these Ohiotowns be for persons of small fortune or to tradesmen All thecomforts of life can be obtained with little expense while good airand good laws shed health and peace around Our passengers and freightexchanged for others we turned our course from the shore and followedthe249 bends of La Belle riviere worthy of its name as it wound througha well settled country its shadowy hills now appearing more frequentlygiving a more varied character to the scenery The water grows purer aswe ascend and shallower so that we can at times distinguish the sandand stones at the bottom The Buckeye tree is seen in large groves orpretty groups or copses giving a very cultivated air to the shores aswe had been used to see it ornamenting our streets under the ugly namehorsechesnut But although much alike in external appearance our treeis a transplanted one originally from Asia the Æsculus Hippocastinumwhile this tree is a native of Ohio designated by the botanist as theÆsculus Ohioensis There are here seven species of this tree which fromtheir deep green glossy leaves and pretty flowers are a great ornamentto the groves of Ohio It is an useful tree and from the softness ofits wood is easy to cut In the early days of Ohio when the settlerswere in want of many articles of household furniture they resorted tothe buckeye After building their log cabins of its branches theyformed according to Dr Drake cradles tables bowls plattersspoons and troughs for gathering maple sap The covering of the nut canbe used as soap while starch and medicine are also procured from itThe nut being brown with a round white spot upon it is called buckeyeand in consequence of their frequent use and constant praises of thistree the people of Ohio received from their neighbors the soubriquet ofBuckeyes The western people are fond of these nicknames I told you theIllinoisians were called Suckers the Missourians are Pukes theKentuckians Corncrackers250 Virginians Tuckahoes Indianians HoosiersMichiganians Wolverines c While sailing or rather to use the customary phrase here riding alongthese western rivers one is struck with the destruction of trees Whatmagnificent forests we passed today where the huge and toweringsycamore the dark green buckeye the lighter cotton wood the tall andgraceful shaft of the sugar maple the white elm with its beautifullyarranged branches and purple flowers the silvery white maple the oakthe beech woven together by missletoe and other creepers on the Ohioshore and on the Kentucky bank the blue ash the coffee tree statelytulip yellow locust dark leaved hackberry basswood and hundreds ofothers make a mass of glorious forest scenery such as I am sure earthcannot surpass But the great rise and fall and changes of this riverand its shores destroy hundreds of these noble creations in a yearCountless numbers we saw along the banks with all their roots exposedholding but by one slight one which any blast of wind might loosenwhen it falls and is washed away The shores were strewed with them inall stages many struck down in youth with their young foliage aboutthem others in the sere and yellow leaf while others again stripped ofleaf and bark are piled in great ‘wreck heaps’ where the current hashurled them or floating down the stream in time to become a snag andlie in wait to impale some unconscious vessel While looking upon themin their innocence and beauty I could not but pity their vampire fateso soon to be transformed into malicious snags to destroy the passingvoyager The quantity of yellow clay marl which occurs along the251shores contributes to their destruction as it easily crumbles awayThis also gives the peculiar rounded form to the Ohio hills as the marlis washed down giving the hills a smooth round shape At Sandy river a stream which runs one hundred and sixty miles throughVirginia we bade adieu to old Kentuck The rich and fertile plains ofKentucky were the favorite hunting grounds of the Aborigines of thesurrounding regions as there the buffalo elk deer c roved in largeherds Extremely unwilling to surrender it to the white intruders theIndians fought long and bravely for it and so many severe battles tookplace there that Kentucky acquired among the Indians the name of ‘thedark and bloody ground’ The inhabitants have long been celebrated fortheir valor Some of the scenery of Kentucky is the most beautiful inthe States and some of the land the most fertile It is four hundredmiles long and contains twentysix million acres The wonderful cavernswhich occur in the limestone formations you have heard of Populationbetween six and seven hundred thousand Virginia the land of thecavaliers and of Pocahontas looked very inviting as we sailed pastit her pretty hills lending beauty to every view At Guyandot welanded a party to visit the Sulphur Springs in Virginia which are nowquite fashionable Our springs at Saratoga and Ballston lose manysouthern and western visitors since these and so many others have beendiscovered in those regions July 22nd—Off Gallipolis a town settled by French people who camehere to avoid the excesses of the revolution These persons brought upin a delicate252 luxurious manner were obliged to plunge at once intoall the hardships of a woodland life and suffered much ere their houseswere erected and all things in order Upon the opposite shore theKenawha enters the Ohio after coming from the iron mountain in NorthCarolina through Kentucky three hundred miles It has dug for itself adeep bed in the limestone rocks and upon its banks is the most ruggedand picturesque scenery in Kentucky Coal and salt springs abound alongits shores The rapids of the Ohio came in sight after this and lookedcool and pretty as the water curled and foamed over the ledges of rocksand pebbles The water was very clear and we seemed sailing upon thebottom but being so unusually low our boat as small as she wasgrounded several times In these extremities recourse was had tocordelling A rope was carried ahead by a small boat and fastened toa rock or anchored and a windlass brought the boat up to the rockAfter passing the rapids the river becomes shallower and more narrowbut as our boat only drew twenty inches we succeeded in going on whilesome larger ones which had accompanied us thus far were left in theriver or at some village The islands are more frequent and some ofthem very lovely mazes of beautiful forest trees woven together innatural bowers by pea vines in blossom scarlet creeper and many otherpretty and new plants The island of the unfortunate Blennarhasset isthe largest and loveliest containing seven hundred acres Through thecircle of forest trees which border it we caught glimpses of the centrewhich was level and once highly cultivated Here he created a paradiseof lawns and groves and gardens surrounding253 a dwelling the residenceof his charming family to which were attached green and hothouseslibraries and music rooms Ambition has rendered this fair spot adesert he never rose to the empire which he and his tempter Burr hadhoped to create After all the saddest part of Herman Blennarhasset’sfate is that every tourist who passes the island must mention his nameand utter an effecting sentimentality about ambition it seems likedragging him out of his resting place to hear our taunts if you travelthis way let me beg of you— Parkersburgh at the mouth of the little Kenawha is a quaint oldfashioned town in Virginia embosomed in hills Here we intended to landand take the mail stage to Winchester but it had just departed andrather than remain there two days until another stage we concluded togo on in the Agnes to Wheeling Accordingly we and our trunks were againon board and we resumed our rambles At sunset we stopped at the townof Marietta the first spot settled in Ohio Its name was very prettilygiven in honor of the fair and unfortunate Maria Antoinette of Francein gratitude for the support she gave our cause The town was laid outin 1788 The streets are wide and adorned with forest trees and parksThe houses are solidly built having each its ornamented court andgarden The exchange courthouse college churches and other publicbuildings are handsome structures It is principally settled by NewEnglanders whose love of good order and morality has not been leftbehind for the motto254 upon the town seal pledges their ‘support ofreligion and learning’ Marietta is upon the Muskingum which is betweentwo and three hundred yards wide and navigable for one hundred mileswith large boats It is a remarkably pure healthy bright stream‘rolling its limpid waves over a sandy and pebbly bottom variegated insummer months with the open valves of thousands of red and white shellsscattered among the sand rivalling in beauty the richest tessellatedpavement of the Romans’ Upon its banks stands Zanesville a large andhandsome town and in the county through which this river and itsbranches flow are quantities of iron coal salt limestone and manyother useful productions There are also ancient mounds andfortifications upon its shores Marietta appears beautifully as weapproach seated upon an elevated bank at the foot of a range of thepicturesque Ohio hills These are about three hundred feet high formedof ‘argillacious earth based upon sandstone’ The scenery thisafternoon is of a grander cast than any we had yet seen upon the OhioThe hills which have generally risen at some distance from the shorenow come close down to the water so that as we ride along we can lookfar up into their recesses They have the same gracefully regularappearance except that now and then a ledge of sandstone or limestonebreaks the smooth green side I have said very little about the cooking and victuals upon thesewestern boats The latter are very good and finer beef fish breadetc cannot be found any where the most fastidious palate might herebe satisfied were it not for one thing—our western brethren are so fondof fat Almost every dish of animal food is swiming in a greasy liquorDoubtless I should255 be used to it in time and like it as well as ouryoung southern friend who used to expatiate upon the delights of hominyand ‘possum fat’ However I cannot expect persons wherever I maychoose to travel to shape their table to please me so I make a pointof taking things as quietly as if I had ordered every thing I generallysucceeded by declining gravey to obtain a piece tolerably dry andthis with their excellent vegetables Indian bread good butter andnice stewed dried peaches the unfailing accompaniment to every meal tosecure a pleasant and healthful repast Tea and coffee we have met ofall shades and varieties but none so unique as the prairie coffee ofwhich I wrote you The accommodations are comfortable and in the ladiesapartment towels basins and water enough and leave to use your ownbrushes The gentlemen were confined to tin washbowls upon deck but ifany one chose to ask he might always have a basin and towel in hiscabin We found nothing to complain of as serious annoyances butreceived every attention and politeness from captains and servants256 Wheeling Virginia July 23d Although weary of the constant jar of these high pressure steamboatsand glad once more to step upon firm land yet when told Wheeling wasin sight I felt regret that I must now turn my back upon the beautifulOhio and the charming western land I ought not to leave the fair Stateof Ohio without saying a few words to give you an idea of its extent andcondition—matters which you may perhaps extract from Gazateersyourself but this will save you the trouble Gazateers and touristsguides however are of little use in a region which so rapidly changesits appearance and increases its population Where you are directed toremark the beauty of a grand forest you find a large town and wherewhen the book was written spread out a fair prairie you find a countrycovered with farm houses cornfields fences and orchards Along thecoast of Ohio we have sailed over an hundred miles on lake Erie andupon the Ohio river four hundred miles From Cincinnati here which isall that distance except twenty257 or thirty miles we paid twelvedollars six each which with board for three days is not expensivetravelling The State of Ohio is nearly square being two hundred andtwentytwo miles long by two hundred broad and with Indiana andIllinois are parts of a great plain which inclines to the Mississippithrough which the rivers have cut their way into their deep beds Thegeology of these States is very much the same they being based uponthat great secondary limestone formation which reaches from the easternStates to the Chippewayan mountains and from the great lakes to thealluvion of the southern States This is doubtless the deposite of theprimitive ocean as it occurs ‘in layers of chrystaline and sedimentaryor in broken pieces cemented together’26 It is of all shades fromthe dark brown ferruginous to the light grey the blue fœtid theyellow silecious and magnesian the argillaceous earthy chrystalineoolitic etc In this limestone formation is a variety of fossil shellsof many species as the ammonites spiriferi encrini producticorallines gryphea madrepores and various others Its thickness isenormous for it has been penetrated one thousand feet without reachingthe primitive rocks27 Above this is the sandstone and slate andclay of the coal measures and muriatiferous rocks These sandstones aregenerally white ash color or brown a very little red has beendiscovered in this valley One of our western friends who has wellstudied the geology of that region was of opinion that all the groupsof fossiliferous secondary strata recognized and determined by Europeangeologists have not been discovered here but that258 they claim the uppernew red sandstone and oolites that have not been subdivided thatabove the oolites they have unconsolidated strata of great extent andthickness which do not abound in fossils and have not beensufficiently observed to justify and attempt to confer names upon themSeveral of the groups of the European secondary are thought to bewanting here The chalk group is certainly wanting nor have any of thefour received divisions of the supercretaceous or tertiary beenidentified in the western valley The older pliocene and it is thoughtthe newer have been observed in Alabama The recent pliocene is hereestablished the accumulation of gigantic fossil remains of mammalia atBig Bone Lick Kentucky at Bucyrus Ohio at Pomme de Terre Missouriand at Rocky Spring near St Louis identify this group with certaintyThe recent pliocene is not horizontal it having been seen fifteenhundred feet or more above the level of the sea Its remains ofelephants tetracaulidons and other fossils identical with existinggenera upon the earth demonstrates its geological era to be near usThere are several remarkable deposites in Ohio and the surroundingStates—the sileceous ferruginous muriatiferous and the coal Thesileceous deposite sometimes called ‘Flint ridge’ runs nearly throughthe State of Ohio in a southwesterly direction from the Tuscarawasriver to the Sciota near the Ohio Its greatest width is four or fivemiles being strewed over the ground in broken masses beneath the soilor which is its most common situation upon the tops of the hillsdoubtless thrown up from the ocean in a fluid and heated state Thisdeposite occurs generally white but is occa259sionally streaked withvarious hues and is compact cellular and vermicular The aboriginalinhabitants made great use of it for arrow heads and the presentsettlers find it very valuable as whetstones hones and millstonesThe latter are thought equal to the French buhr stone and are sold tothe amount of twenty thousand dollars a year Those from the depositeupon Raccoon creek are very celebrated In this silecious materialoccurs marine shells beautiful and limpid quartz chrystals veins ofchalcedony sulphate of barytes flint hornstone and various otherminerals The ferruginous deposite crosses the State from northeast tosouthwest commencing at the division line between Ohio andPennsylvania upon lake Erie to the mouth of the Sciota and thencecontinues into Kentucky to the Cumberland mountains its average widthbeing from fifteen to twenty miles The iron occurs in severalvarieties as a brown oxide an argillaceous ore pure highlycarbonated ore etc Its forms are also various the ore occurringlamellated disseminated in kidney shaped masses columnar stalactiticcubic in rhombic fragments nodules etc It is extensively worked inmany furnaces of Ohio and Kentucky In this iron are marine shells andplants of a tropical climate I have spoken of the muriatiferous rocks and I will now pass on to thecoal measures The quantity of coal found in these western States iswonderful The valley of the Ohio and it now appears the valley of theMississippi are underlaid with coal The Alleghany mountains are filledwith it at their bases it is heaped up in masses probably ofantediluvial vegetation by the eddies of the currents These moun260tainsseem to divide the anthracite from the bituminous coal There is enoughof this article in Ohio to last thousands of years twelve thousandsquare miles being underlaid with it in one grand basin In Indianaaccording to Dr Owen the coal formation occupies seven thousand sevenhundred and eighty square miles in Pennsylvania the bituminous coalembraces an area of twentyone thousand square miles while in theStates west of these coal is found in considerable quantities but ithas not been thoroughly examined The richest deposit of coal in thevalley of the Ohio is the basin through which runs the Monongahelariver it is two hundred miles in length and one hundred in breadth28It occurs extensively in layers across the hills—that of Coal hill atPittsburg supplies the city which it uses in its great manufactoriesThe coal consumed in this city and its suburbs is estimated at ‘sevenmillions six hundred and sixtyfive thousand bushels’ This usefularticle is easily procured throughout the west and is consequently verycheap being two four or eight cents a bushel in different places Theiron and salt furnaces and manufactories of the west owe their presentflourishing trade to the abundance of this material This coal is blackbituminous generally burns freely and in some deposits forms verygood coke which is used in the furnaces In Licking Co Ohio is adeposit of Canal coal and another in Guernsey Co Beside theseinteresting minerals there are numerous others in the Ohio valley whichare very valuable upon Wills creek Ohio is a deposit of fine liaslimestone—and there are in the State261 various other stones suitable forbuilding—sandstones of fine quality used for architecturalpurposes—gypsum lead copper c The coal measures abound in organicremains some of them belonging to the tropical palms and ferns are verybeautiful and perfect When we see how important these articles are tothe western land and how profusely they are scattered and how easilyobtained one cannot think they are thus arranged by accidentalconvulsions of nature We know that the greatest coal deposits are abovethe thirtieth degree of latitude and is not this because theinhabitants below this degree do not so much require it while thecolder countries would be almost deserts without it so good andbeneficient is our great Father You will say I am like the old womanwho praised the goodness of God for making rivers flow by the side ofcities I think there is double enjoyment in every gift when we feel itis from His compassionate hand Ohio is one of the finest agriculturalcountries in the world Her productions are justly celebrated for theirgoodness and quantity Her exports in flour last year is said to beseven million five hundred thousand dollars The land belonging to thegovernment sells here as in the other States for one dollar andtwentyfive cents an acre Around large towns the owner of the lots asksof course more We must bid Ohio now adieu and look around us a littleWe were approaching Wheeling when I thus digressed It appears very wellfrom the water you see a circle of swelling green hills with the brightriver encircling a large island in the midst The town runs in a longline across the slope of one of the hills while a group of steamboatslooking262 wonderfully like a flock of geese were floating upon the waterbeneath People are busy taking out coal from the hills and trundlingit down a wooden railway into the vessels below The hills are betweentwo and three hundred feet high the coal stretches along their facefor fifteen miles and then dips into the earth It is a kind valuablefor cooking and some of it is beautifully irridescent Themanufactories of Wheeling are supplied with it and it is extensivelysold down the river at the cost of three cents a bushel when deliveredto the boat One million five hundred thousand bushels of coal areexported from Wheeling every year Wheeling is a second Pittsburgblackened with coal while the smoke is rising from forge and furnaceand chimney in every direction Here we found the best landing of anytown upon the river as the steep bank was walled up and we ascended bya long flight of steps When upon the top of the wharf we foundourselves before a range of shops and hotels while before us was the‘United States’ where we deposited ourselves and luggage After tea weset out for a stroll through the town accompanied by a very agreeableparty who had left the boat with us the remainder of our passengersgoing on to Pittsburg about ninety miles farther We had been throughso many new towns that this looked quite antique it being settled inseventeen hundred and seventy by Col Zane and his brothers whoafterwards founded Zanesville The streets here run along the face ofthe hill and contain many shops manufactories a large courthousehotels banks and dwellings Among the buildings are seven churches anacademy iron and brass foun263deries flint glass works paper and sawmills steam engine and machinery works nail factory cordage wirefloorcloth factories c Eight stages arrive and depart each daySundays excepted and various steamboats stop here—so if you know ofany mechanics or tradespeople complaining of want of work in yourcrowded city tell them to wend their way hitherward All kind oflaborers will find business enough in the west I think a society forexporting over the Alleghanies the poor European emigrants who aresuffering in our large cities would be of great service to them and tous The population we were told nearly numbered ten thousand Among thehouses we observed one quite large and handsome this we were told wasbuilt by Col Zane when the town was first settled and his descendantshave resided there since He was an active pioneer of the wildernessand encountered many difficulties and fought many battles with theIndians ere he was permanently settled in his beautiful abode In theseattacks the females of Wheeling showed much heroism and took an activepart in the affray The little settlement was once attacked by threehundred and eighty Indians when Col Zane had with him but thirtythreemen but the women shouldered their rifles joined in the battle and didmuch execution Once in despair the garrison inclined to a surrenderbut a young girl named Betsey Wheat answered them in such an eloquentand indignant burst of irony that they rallied and defeated the enemyIn a second attack Elizabeth the sister of Col Zane saved the fort bybringing into it a quantity of powder braving but passing unhurtthrough the whizzing balls directed against her by the Indians264 Some ofthe buildings here are of the light sandstone of the country July 24th—We were aroused early by the trampling of steeds and uponlooking out beheld several fine stages each having four horses whichwere soon to start upon their different roads Our breakfast over wewith the party mentioned above entered a large convenient coach and justas the clock struck seven left the hotel Upon reaching the top of thehill above the town we looked down upon as fair a scene as any we hadseen in our travels The town was strewed over the hill below us whilethe beautiful Ohio lay like a circlet of silver around a pretty islandcovered with waving corn and dotted with farmhouses and then glidedaway in its course winding among the soft green hills until itdisappeared behind one of them The island is Zane’s island containingthree hundred and fifty acres We had now looked our last upon thelovely valley of the Ohio and its beautiful river the Belle riviere ofthe French and Ohio Peekhanne of the Indian This valley is from thesources of the Ohio to the Mississippi eleven hundred miles in lengthand nearly three hundred miles in breadth It sweeps down from theAlleghanies at an elevation of two thousand two hundred and thirty feetto the Ohio and then ascends gently four hundred feet to the ridge whichdivides its waters from those which flow into the gulf of St Lawrencea distance of nearly three hundred miles Through this valley winds ingraceful bends the noble Ohio eleven hundred miles from its source andnine hundred and fortyeight from its junction with the265 Monongohela atPittsburg It divides the valley in two unequal portions having onehundred and sixteen thousand square miles upon the southeast side andeighty thousand upon the northwest This valley enjoys a pleasanttemperature not too cold to paralyze exertion and not so warm as toenervate Its soil is capable of yielding fruits vegetables andgrains of the finest quality and in great profusion and mineralproducts of the utmost importance to man and it is settled by a freevirtuous and enlightened people add to this the scenery is beautifuland varied and I think you will look far to find a region of countryuniting so many advantages The dark clouds of slavery which shadow itsborders is the only spot in its fair horizon The valley of the Ohio isin the centre of a great plain which as the Appalachian chain waselevated raised up that portion and consequently the rivers which flowover that division come with more impetuosity and dig for themselvesdeep trenches in the earth Many who have carefully examined this regionare of opinion the regular hills which border the Ohio and many of itstributaries are parts of the primitive plain which the streams haveworn down into their present shapes In this valley lies that great coalbasin which is so ably described by Dr Hildreth in the American Journalof Science It extends over four or five degrees of latitude and asmany of longitude A circle drawn from the head waters of the Muskingumto the sources of the Alleghany and from thence to those of theMonongohela and Kenawha would mark the extent of this depositcomprising portions of Pennsylvania Virginia Ohio and Kentucky Adieu to the fair Ohio It has carried us for nearly266 nine hundred milesin safety upon its bosom unharmed by snag or sawyer and I say withMilton Our day’s journey was very delightful The country is rolling andalternately pretty hill and dale scenery and winding rivulets Thefirst part of our ride was through Virginia but in a short time at thevillage of Alexandria we entered Pennsylvania We drove over thenational road which runs from Cumberland in Maryland and passesthrough the intervening States to Vandalia Illinois from whence it isexpected to be finished to Alton This is a firm McAdamized road eightyfeet broad carried over mountains vallies and rivers crossing thelatter as well as every ravine and depression by well built stonebridges This very useful and well executed work was done by governmentat the suggestion of our statesman Henry Clay We passed a neat farmhouse before which stood a bronze statue of Clay placed there by awidow lady owner of the place in gratitude for the benefit this roadhad produced to her property We of course were in duty bound to admirethe statue while rolling so rapidly and smoothly over this excellentroad At Washington Pa we dined a pretty town having threechurches hotels and shops with a college a large building in thecentre of pleasant grounds A large courthouse of brick was inprogress The267 dinner was good but plain The hills which we passed inthe afternoon were covered with rich pasture land where sheep andcattle were making a fine feast These grassy hills are famous for the‘glade butter’ which is celebrated around the country and which wefound very sweet and fresh While descending the side of one of thesehills we were told Brownsville Pa was in sight and looking down webeheld a town in the valley with the pretty Monongohela glistening inthe bright sun as it wound its way around the hills Rattling over afine strong covered bridge we stopped to change horses before theprincipal hotel This is a large manufacturing town containing fivethousand inhabitants Steamboats are here built and completely fittedup and when the river is high they run to Pittsburg sixty milesdistant The hills are high around abounding in bituminous coal andlaid with strata of limestone and sandstone The coal here is very richDark heavy masses after we had left this place began to appear in thehorizon and we were rejoiced to hear they were the celebrated Alleghanymountains We took tea at Uniontown Pa at the foot of the chesnutridge and soon after began to ascend the mountain Our mountain ridewas delightful and when near the summit we all descended from the stagecoach to enjoy the views What a glorious thing to stand upon the topof a mountain How exultingly you gaze upon the world below You feel soproud of the great feat you have performed you breathe freer theheavens seem nearer and brighter and the earth—but do not let me speakagainst the earth for never had it looked more enchanting than whenlooking upon268 it from the summit of the Alleghanies The fair fields ofPennsylvania were spread out below varied with herbage of every shadewith groves and villages and streams whose waters were tinted withrose from the setting sun around in every direction was a green oceanof hill tops robed in a vesture of purple haze You will smile at myheroics upon the summit of so small a mountain as one of theAlleghanies scarcely three thousand feet above the earth and think itbetter applied to the Chimborazo Popocatapetl or even Rocky Mountainsbut fortunately I have never been upon higher ground and enjoy theview from the Appalachian range as much as if I stood upon the Nevadosof our southern continent twentyfive thousand feet above the seaDepend upon it those who have seen every thing who have been roweddown the Nile climbed the rocks of Petra worshipped at Jerusalemtoiled up the Himalayas and frozen in Siberia are no happier than wewho have been creeping about the circle of our home To everything youcall upon them to admire they answer ‘J’ai vu’ they have seeneverything If you praise a song they turn away with scorn and speak ofthe opera at Naples if you ask them to visit our springs or our citiesthey talk of the spa’s of Europe of Paris of London and PetersburghThey have nothing to do but fold their hands grumble at the presentand live upon the past I have not seen and therefore may be allowed toexpatiate upon the beauties of the Alleghanies All that night we droveup the hills and down the hills shut up in the stage coach We wereglad of our cloaks for it was very cold and at every stopping place wefound fires269 although at the foot of the mountains the thermometerstood at eighty We talked merrily at first and kept up each othersspirits but towards midnight we grew cold and weary and one afteranother sank into silence There was much nodding and dozing but littlesleeping for as soon as one fell into a doze another was sure to askyou if you could sleep or how you came on a question sure to put toflight your endeavors At last hopeless of sleep we gave it up bymutual consent and tried to amuse each other by stories One of ourparty was a western merchant who had frequently travelled over thesemountains and met with numerous adventures He told us of an adventurewhich befel him twenty years since when the mountains were littletravelled and only accessible on horseback He was carrying a large sumof money in his saddlebags which he feared had been discovered by twoill looking men whom he had seen in the tavern where he had stopped justat dusk He for some time felt a little fear but the night had nearlyworn away and he had not seen any one when soon after midnight as hewas pacing slowly along he fancied he caught a glimpse of a manstanding by the road side just before him He gazed intently through thedarkness and saw distinctly two men who drew farther out of themoonlight into the shade of the trees as he approached He knew not whatto do he was not armed no house was near and if he left the road hemust be lost in the pathless woods Go on he must and he determined toput spurs to his horse and dart past them He gazed forward to see ifhis path were clear a deep silence reigned around when ‘Dismount andgive up your270 money’ resounded like thunder in his ears echoing awayamong the silent aisles of the mountain forest Two men were before himhis whip was wrenched from his hands he was dragged to the ground therobbers mounted his steed and rode away ‘Well there I was in a prettyfix anyhow’ he said ‘sitting upon a mound of snow all alone in awild wood at midnight my two hundred dollars and my horse all gone Imight have said with Shakspeare’s queen ‘Here I in sorrow sit’ etcbut I was not in a poetical mood anyhow Besides I could blame no onebut myself for I ought to have kept my eye skinned and not have beenso blind as not to see the danger of travelling in wild parts with somuch gold Still if the parts were wild we had never heard of anyrobbery committed here and did not expect it’ ‘Did you ever discoverthe robbers’ we asked ‘Oh yes I went back to the village and everyone turned out to help me There was snow on the ground and we were thusable to track them I was forced to go all the way to Buffalo howeverere one was caught by the police He had lived like a prince all alongthe road and spent his share of the money’ ‘What became of the otherman’ ‘Why ma’am as I was one day walking through Pratt street inBaltimore some months after whom should I meet but my man dressed inthe newest style parading along as proud as a prairie cock with agrand lady upon each arm I knew him as I had remarked him at thetavern and by the bright moonlight He also remembered me and when hesaw my eye so eagerly fixed upon him without saying good bye to theladies or even waiting upon them home he scattered at once down the271street and I after him If you had seen the ladies stare Away he wentup street down street along the wharves in the vessels out again Atlast thinking he had dodged me he sprang into an empty hogshead But Iwasn’t to be did that way anyhow so I flung a board over the top andstanding on it clapped my arms and crowed in such a tone of triumphthat all the cocks in the neighboring yards crowed in concert In shortmy man was treed and imprisoned but my money was gone’ July 25th—At daybreak I lifted the curtain and by the uncertainlight of dawn beheld at my side a wide river whose opposite shoreswere green and hilly ‘Are we over the mountains already What river canthis be’ I asked With a smile one of the party informed me we were onthe summit of a high mountain and the deep valley filled with mistwith the opposite summits for a shore made my river A bright sun soondispersed the mist and we were never tired of the variety of views webeheld upon every hand That the mountains are not very high adds to thebeauty of the scene their heads are not lost in the clouds and wefrequently see the whole mass at once While descending one Alleghany webeheld another before us like a high green wall reaching to theheavens while a line across the summit showed the road we were totravel so high and precipitous it seemed that we wondered how we evershould reach the road Descending again this ridge we gazed out over agreat extent of country or down into deep valleys brightened bywinding streams while trees and flowers and vines of every tint andform adorned272 the path The laurels were out of bloom but their deepgreen glossy leaves shone out continually from the foliage The chesnutwas also frequent these two giving names to the two ridges we hadpassed Laurel and Chesnut ridges We also remarked the pretty stripedmaple whose green bark is striped with black This is sometimes calledmoose wood as the moosedeer always seeks with avidity its tenderleaves and bark The box elder also occurs upon these slopes with theholly and varieties of the magnolia the turpelo gum tree besidesnoble forests of many other trees The road although leading overmountain ridges and passes is not a lonely one as stages loaded withpassengers were continual passing and huge Pennsylvanian waggons withthe large Normandy horses high collar and jingling a bell to givenotice of their approach The women of the country we often met uponhorseback sitting upon their gaily embroidered saddles The fine broadsmooth National road over which we were passing enabled the drivers tokeep their horses upon a very quick trot I am fond of rapid drivingbut sometimes it made me rather nervous to dash at the rate of eightmiles an hour within two feet of a precipice down which we looked uponthe tops of trees a thousand feet below There is however very littledanger as where the descent is steep the driver can in a moment byputting his foot upon a spring at his side cramp the wheel and checkour speed After ascending a high mountain we found a tavern whosesign bore the hospitable words ‘Welcome from the west’ We were muchpleased with this kind reception until upon looking back perceivedupon the other side of the273 sign ‘welcome from the east’ I wish thegood lady who erected a statue to Clay would place a monument upon theAlleghanies to commemorate honest Daniel Boon who claims to be thefirst who discovered the fair western plains Sir Alexander Spotswood agovernor of Virginia penetrated part of the way through the mountainsThere was no National road then and the hills were almost impassableTo stimulate discovery he instituted the order of the goldenhorseshoe for those who could pass the Blue Ridge He was anxious tocounteract the influence of the French upon the Mississippi Thereshould also be a statue to good old Father Marquette upon the shore ofLake Michigan as before him no white man had penetrated farther inthe wilderness He persevered and discovered the Mississippi We passedseveral towns as Smythfield Petersburg Frostburg Cumberland cThis last town is in Maryland upon a branch of the Potomac one hundredand forty miles from Baltimore The scenery around it is beautiful Itlies in a valley through which glistens the Potomac river surroundedby mountains We reached it this morning after descending a slope whichseemed to rise one mass of rocks above us The town has several largehotels a college courthouse and many shops We stopped here tochange horses Here commences the transition formations the Appalachianrange dividing the transition from the secondary formations of thewestern valley So clear and distinct is this division that thecelebrated geologist Dr Aikin fixed upon the ground betweenCumberland and Hancock forty miles distant as the spot where theAppalachian chain emerged from beneath upheaved274 by igneous action Themountain which we descended to Cumberland is called the Alleghany bypreeminence it being the highest elevation and is the ridge whichdivides the waters which flow into the Ohio from those which reach theAtlantic The rocks which we had observed upon our road were the usuallimestone marl and conglomerates of the west mixed with muchbituminous coal while now we remarked with them grey wacke andtransition slates The Baltimore and Ohio railroad will pass throughCumberland and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal Here also the Nationalcommences and we there left it but found a very good one whichcontinued with some failures during the day We dined at Pine Grove asmall village Near the hotel is a sulphur spring which we were obligedto taste to gratify the landlord and which was as nauseous as onecould desire This afternoon we passed some very pretty mountainscenery none so high as those we had left behind for we were only uponthe steps which lead down from the ridge to the plains below FromSidling Hill we looked down into a large valley surrounded by a circleof hills through which a river winding its way formed several islandsIn the centre was a high rounded knoll covered with fields of ripenedgrain its bright yellow contrasting well with the dark woods whichsurround it They have a curious way here of laying the grain when cutin squares or circles which looks very pretty at a distance We tooktea at Hancock a town upon the banks of the Potomac The Chesapeake andOhio canal is finished as far as this place We were but little overhalf way to Baltimore here having come we were told one hundred andsixty275 miles from Wheeling Another night was passed in the stage onlyvaried by occasional stoppages to change horses About daybreak westopped at Hagarstown a very large thriving place containingchurches academies and many handsome private dwellings The hotelwhich we entered while the horses were changed was large and seemedvery commodious After leaving it we found the valley in which itstands was very highly cultivated It is underlaid with a dark bluelimestone the soil is very rich and the wheat which it produces issent to Baltimore and highly esteemed We saw some of this limestonewhich occasionally cropped out veins of calcareous spar crossed theblue in some instances Quartz pebbles and large nodules were spreadover the country for miles between this town and Frederic as if astorm of enormous hail had spent its fury over the land Rounded piecesas large as a man’s fist and white as milk lay against the fences orwere piled up by the husbandman The county to Frederic is very prettyundulating cultivated and well settled while dark masses in thedistant horizon told us our pretty mountains were far behind us July 26th—At eleven o’clock we reached Frederick city where webreakfasted This is a very pretty city having an air of antiquity aswe now had arrived in an old settled country and the newly paintedtowns were giving place to what are called old although not what anEuropean would deem aged I was almost too sleepy to see much of it butas we rattled over paved streets and looked upon rows of houses weseemed quite at home again276 We bade adieu to the stagecoach and after a good breakfast enteredthe railroad car and were whirled along with a rapidity which wasfrightful after our stagecoach pace The cars were handsomelyfinished having an apartment appropriated to the ladies wherereclining upon the blue satin sofas we relieved our cramped limbs Thecountry between Frederick and Baltimore is very pretty I think it isabout sixty miles from the one place to the other We passed many goodhouses surrounded with fine farms having the shining Monocasy riverwinding among them We crossed this and the Petapsco over severalbridges The latter river flows between high banks of granite Fifteenmiles from Baltimore are the celebrated Ellicots mills built of thegranite of the cliffs upon which they stand where is ground theexcellent Baltimore flour raised from the fertile country aroundFrederick and Hagarstown Some of the deep cuts of the railroad seem tobe through a mass of debris of all colours red white and blue mixedwith talcose slate and blue limestone until near Baltimore when weentered that granitic belt which stretched through the Atlantic borderto Georgia and which is supposed once to have been the originalAtlantic coast before the band of alluvion was formed After passingmany fanciful country seats and the fine viaduct which leads toWashington we beheld Baltimore an enormous mass of brick and stonelying upon the shore of Petapsco bay Our western friends were delightedand surprised at the sight of so large a city while driving through thestreet We arrived at Barnham’s large and elegant hotel just as theywere eating dinner We had infringed upon our Sabbath277 thus far withoutintending it as we were told we should arrive in Baltimore in time formorning services In the afternoon and evening however there wasopportunity of joining in public worship which my husband and some ofthe party embraced leaving us the weaker part at home to rest July 27th—As we did not leave Baltimore until halfpast nine wewere enabled to see much of it Its monuments to Washington and to theheroes of the last war are handsome and the fountain with its coolcanopy of shadowy elms pretty its churches and public buildings verygood but as you are so well acquainted with it I will not trouble youwith any details We entered the railroad car at halfpast nine andreached New York at eleven that night a distance of two hundred milesfor which we paid eight dollars each Several long bridges carried usover Bush creek Gunpowder river and the noble Susquehanna Our westernfriends who had been boasting of their great rivers seemed surprisedat the little use we made of them in travelling ‘It seems’ said ourfair Missouri lady ‘rivers here are of no consequence—indeed are inthe way as you make bridges and drive over them’ At one o’clock we reached Wilmington the capitol of Delaware ThisState was a Swedish settlement named by Gustavus Adolphus Nova Sueciasince which time Dutch English and Americans have successively ownedit We dined at Wilmington and then hastening on passed through Chesterand a rich level country to the beautiful city of Philadelphia Leavingour rail278road at the depot we drove through the whole length of thecity where at five o’clock we entered the cars again turned ourfaces towards New York which we reached as I said at eleven o’clockthe road being along the Delaware and through some rich farms withelegant mansions and huge Pennsylvania barns through Bristol andTrenton in New Jersey when darkness spread over the land and we saw nomore And now farewell to the THE END FOOTNOTES 1 Sunday schools have been maintained and in pursuance of
