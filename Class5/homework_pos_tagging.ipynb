Since she has been ‘urged by friends to print,’\\nthe author has added to her notes and letters, some little information\\nregarding the western States, in hopes her book may be of use to future\\ntourists and emigrants, who will here find an account of the distances,\\nprices, and conveyances, throughout the author’s route. Anxious to guard\\nagainst errors, information acquired upon the road, has been compared\\nwith the best Gazeteers. Accuracy, in a newly settled country, is\\ndifficult, and accounts differ much; still the author trusts the\\ntraveller who may honor her by taking her book for his guide, will not\\nbe far mis-led.',\n"," '{13}',\n"," 'New York, May, 1841.',\n"," '\\nJune 14th, 1840.\\n',\n"," 'My dear E.—The variety of scenes which have passed before my eyes\\nsince I last beheld you, and the crowd of new ideas acquired thereby,\\nhave not obliterated your Shaksperian adieu from my mind:',\n"," 'were your last words—in consequence of this desire, I hereby send you\\nall I deem note-worthy. With what delight did I find myself once more\\nupon the Hudson! Although so often seen, to me it is still lovely, for\\ncustom cannot stale its beauties. I pass along this river as through a\\ngallery of cabinet pictures. The sunny vista and romantic glen of\\nGains{14}borough—the frowning cliff and murderous dell of Rosa—the Dutch\\ncottage of Teniers—the Italian villa and graceful trees of classic\\nWeir—cattle, as if just sprung from out a Berghman and grouped upon the\\nshore, or standing ‘in the cool translucent wave,’ their ‘loose train of\\namber-dropping hair,’ not being ‘braided with lilies,’ but occupied in\\nflapping the flies away!—all these, and many more are placed side by\\nside before me as I float along.',\n"," 'You have never seen this famed stream, and I will therefore describe it\\nto you minutely. Mine will not be ‘notes by the way,’ nor ‘crayoning,’\\nnor ‘pencil sketches,’ but perfect Daguerrotype likenesses of all I see.',\n"," 'With a bold rush our steamboat was free of the wharf and out into the\\nstream. Ascend now to the upper deck with me and you will obtain a fine\\nview of the city of New York and its noble bay. Upon one side lies the\\ncity with its mass of houses, churches, and vessels; beyond is Long\\nIsland. Observe what a pretty back ground is Staten Island: its numerous\\nwhite buildings show well against the green elevated ridge behind them;\\nthen turn your eye to the opposite side and you will behold New Jersey,\\nwith its pretty city, and villages, and churches; and in the center of\\nall this is the glassy water covered with steamboats, brigs, ships of\\nwar, and vessels of all sizes, and dotted with pretty fortress islets.\\nHoboken with its neat church and romantic colonade are passed, and the\\nrugged cliffs of Weehawken rise upon our left as we ascend the river.\\nThese cliffs are the commencement of the Palisade rocks, which soon\\nretreat into the interior to arise again above. Bul{15}l’s Ferry (worthy of\\na better name,) next appears, with Fort Lee, pretty rural retreats,\\nwhose white houses, churches, and fences, are pencilled as with white\\nchalk upon the river’s green and sloping bank.',\n"," 'From the east side, turret and spire have passed away, and villages and\\ncountry seats adorn the shores until we arrive at Spuyten Duyvel creek,\\nrendered famous by the redoubtable Van Corlear, who swore he would pass\\nit in spigt den Duyvel; and also as being the boundary line of Manhattan\\nIsland. To a hasty observer, the shores beyond this are as lonely and\\nwild as if we were hundreds of miles from any city; but if you will fix\\nyour eyes steadily upon the woodlands which line the river banks, you\\nwill catch glimpses, between the trees, of Grecian portico, Yankee\\npiazza, or Dutch gable, telling of many a summer haunt of the city’s\\n‘tired denizen.’',\n"," 'Upon the west side the Palisade commences, a perpendicular wall, or to\\nspeak more scientifically, ‘a columnar escarpement,’ from three to eight\\nhundred feet high, and two miles broad, thus continuing for twenty miles\\nalong the New Jersey side of the river. As you dabble in geology, I must\\nnot forget to tell you these rocks are of the trap formation, passing\\ninto green stone. Under it are layers of slate, sandstone, and grey\\nlimestone, much of which is used in the city and its neighborhood.\\nSloops were lying at the foot of the rocks, as we passed, taking in\\ntheir load of sandstone flagging, or roofing slate for the use of the\\ncitizens. These sloops, which carry masts sixty or seventy feet high,\\nshow the height of these cliffs, as when seen anchored below them they\\nappear like skiffs. A few stone-cutters have erected{16} cottages upon the\\nrocks, which might be taken for children’s houses. Shrubbery is seen in\\nsome spots, while a green fringe of trees is waving from the summit.\\nThese rocks have stood the brunt of that mighty torrent which wise men\\ntell us once rushed over the country from the north-west, as if some\\nlake had burst its barrier—for bowlders washed from the Palisades are\\nseen in various parts of Manhattan Island and Long Island. To the\\nalluvium brought down by this flood, we are indebted for Manhattan\\nIsland and Staten Island. What a pity ‘wise saws’ are out of fashion, or\\nI could lengthen my epistle by telling what ‘modern instances’ these\\nislands are, of the ‘good’ brought down by ‘ill winds.’',\n"," 'As we are both now tired of these Palisades, it is very pretty of them\\nto retire as they do, into the country, making a fine back ground to the\\nrich land lying upon the river’s bank, adorned with several picturesque\\ntownlets. These are Nyack, reclining upon a verdant slope; Haverstraw,\\nnestled under a high, green promontory; and Tappan, which ought to have\\nbeen first mentioned. This is, however, but the ‘landing’ of the town of\\nthat name, lying a few miles in the interior, and whose ‘heavens’ ought\\nto be ‘hung with black,’ for the sake of the talented and unfortunate\\nAndre, whose silver cord was here untimely loosed.',\n"," 'The river swells out into a broad lake, called Tappan sea, which ought\\nto be spelled Tap-pann Zee. The west side I have described, except that\\nfrom these towns the ground rises into an elevated green ridge of\\nHaverstraw, and then descends gracefully to the water, ending in a low\\nlevel spot, covered with a{17} rich velvet sward, dotted with groups of\\noaks, and evergreens, among which a silver rivulet winds its happy way.\\nThis is very prettily called Grassy Point.',\n"," 'Upon our right hand we have smooth, lawn-like slopes, over which the\\nbuildings of Yonkers, Tarrytown, and Dobbs’ Ferry (harmonious sounds,)\\nare straggling, or reposing in graceful groups upon every gentle swell.\\nSing Sing, with its long range of prisons, is before us; so called, I\\nsuppose, that the inhabitants of those abodes may have something\\ncheerful about them. It is a lovely spot commanding a beautiful view of\\nthe river scenery—so lovely that I am almost tempted to be wicked,\\nthat I may be ordered to reside there, and sit like a Naiad sing singing\\nupon a',\n"," 'That is all very well, you will say, when the rock is already cut out\\nfor you to sit upon; but where one is obliged to hew out one’s own rock,\\nas do these woful sing-singers, it would be as well to abandon the place\\nto the heroes who there do congregate. They quarry a white granular\\nlimestone which is used as building material. The antique Dutch church\\nlooks very well, seated upon an eminence; and Wolfert’s Roost, with its\\nDutch points and gables, the residence of the celebrated Irving, is\\nanother interesting object upon this shore.',\n"," 'Look behind you quickly, if you would take a last farewell of Staten\\nIsland, whose dark outline has, until now, filled up the back ground,\\nalthough we are thirty miles from it. As we turn towards the narrow\\noutlet between Stoney and Verplanck’s Points, the Palisades are sweeping\\naround to the east, and rapidly shoving{18} in their side scene between us\\nand the Island. Now it is gone, and the Narrows are fast being covered,\\nthrough which you might, if your eyes could see so far, descry the green\\nocean and its gallant barks. The river now seems a lake behind us, upon\\nwhose bright bosom a fleet of vessels, like a flock of birds, are\\nskimming, and ducking, or reposing upon the water. Two Points defend\\nthe entrance to the Highlands: Stony Point on the west, a bold rocky\\npromontory, formed of fine horneblend granite rock, and surmounted by a\\nlight-house; Verplanck’s on the east presents a small village,\\ncontaining a pretty fanciful hotel, and some lordly dwellings upon the\\nelevated ground above. These are now behind us, and we find ourselves in\\nthe Grand Pass of the Highlands. Beautiful creations they are—high,\\ngreen cones, sweeping gradually down to the water’s edge, where they\\nsometimes appear a verdant precipice nearly two thousand feet high; or\\nprojecting their spurs into the river, and crossing each other so that\\nthe Hudson must wind hither and thither to follow the tortuous path\\nbetween them. Various lights give new beauties to these hills. It is\\npleasant when the sun shines broad and bright upon them, to penetrate\\nwith your eye their green recesses, or endeavor to distinguish whether\\nthose bushes on the summit are indeed trees or no; and again when a\\ncloud passes, running rapidly over the surface, the effect is very\\nbeautiful. As we were near the centre of the Pass, the sun was obscured,\\nand a heavy shower clothed every thing with gloom.—Through the sombre\\nlight they seemed like giant mastadon or mammoth of olden times,\\ncouching down upon each side, musing upon the changes which have{19} taken\\nplace upon this diluvial earth. The rain has ceased, and the mist has\\nall retired into the mountain caves, save on one spot near the summit,\\nwhere it lowering stands, like one of Ossian’s ghosts, whose wont it is,\\nhe tells us, to ‘fly on clouds, and ride on winds.’ Or, it may be the\\nwandering spirit of some red warrior who has perished on these shores,\\nand now haunts the scene of his former triumphs.',\n"," 'Upon a promontory jutting out from the river, are situated the Military\\nSchools of West Point. It is a summer’s day well spent to ramble over\\nthat pretty spot.

In the morning we walked to the\\nchurch of a Baptist clergyman, Mr. W——h, who has been long celebrated\\nas a very interesting preacher. This church is a handsome marble\\nstructure, surmounted by a dome, and adorned by a colonade of pillars in\\nfront. The lecture room is below, and we ascended to the chapel, a neat\\napartment with a good pulpit and commodious seats. Mr. W. sprang from an\\nobscure station, being a mechanic, and therefore could only obtain a\\ncommon education. What he is, he has made himself, or rather was made by\\nthe Holy Spirit; for we all know how religion refines and elevates the\\nintellect of man, as well as his affections. After his conversion he\\nrapidly improved, and now one is astonished at the beauty and purity of\\nhis language. He is not an animated preacher, nor does his forte lie\\nin arousing a sinner; but he shows forth the{23} truth and beauty of\\nreligion, and expounds the Gospel doctrines with a power and grace, and\\nclearness, which fascinate the hearer. This church is always crowded by\\nthe elite of Albanian society of all sects, and by the strangers who\\nare in the city.',\n"," 'In the afternoon we attended service in an old Dutch church, one of the\\noldest in the city. It is built of brick, and boasts two spires which\\ngive it a singular appearance. The interior is richly fitted up, with\\ngilded chandeliers and many comforts and elegant conveniences. Here we\\nfound ourselves surrounded by the old Dutch families, whose fathers\\nemigrated from Holland and settled themselves here; among them were the\\nfamily of the Patroon. I looked around with pleasure upon the sober\\nbenevolent faces of the congregation, for I have always felt a very\\nkindly sentiment toward our Dutch brethren. The peaceful, even tenor of\\ntheir lives; their contented spirit, their industry and integrity\\nentitle them to our most ‘golden opinions.’ The Rev. Mr. Y——, who\\nofficiates here, is an able, solid, preacher, well versed in the\\nfundamental truths of christianity.',\n"," 'I am happy to say, the people of this city, are a very moral and\\nreligious people. This applies also to the ‘first society’—which is a\\nsingularity in city history. Beneath their influence theatres,\\ndissipation, and extravagance cannot thrive. Already I seem to breathe\\nfreer, although so little distant from New York; whose atmosphere, rank\\nwith foreign luxuries, is like a hot house over-crowded by fragrant\\nexotics; stifling us with perfume.',\n"," 'We admire this city, which however we have only been able to see in our\\nodds and ends of time. Its{24} situation is very fine, it contains many\\nhandsome buildings, and it is generally kept very neat. A broad street\\nthrough the centre leads up to a pretty square, surrounded by several\\nimposing buildings—the Capitol occupies a fine position here; it is of\\ndark stone, with a neat marble portico supported by four ionic columns.\\nThe City Hall on the opposite side of the square, is a noble edifice,\\nbuilt of white marble from the quarries of Sing Sing, surmounted by a\\ngilded dome. The view from this dome is beautiful; embracing the city at\\nyour feet—green hilly country, dotted with country seats and towns,\\namong which is the city of Troy—the noble Hudson, winding among this\\ncountry and a back ground of mountains. The new State Hall is a pretty\\nbuilding—the Exchange, is a huge mass of granite, giving one a great\\nidea of the extent of business which requires so large a structure for\\nits merchants.',\n"," 'What a different place is this to the town which stood upon this two\\nhundred years since. Then the only public building was a quaint old\\nDutch church, with painted glass windows; adorned with the coat of arms\\nof those ancient worthies, who, clad in trunk hose and steeple crowned\\nhats, sat demurely below. There are but few of the ancient Dutch houses\\nleft, and these are daily falling before the yankee spirit of\\nimprovement—which improvement by the bye sometimes merely amounts to\\nalteration.

Soon however, two fine horses, to whom I render my thanks, dragged\\nus out of the barn into open day—up through the square, over the hill,\\nto the Locomotive Depot, giving us on the way many sweet little back\\nviews of Albany and its pretty country and river, and the round tops of\\nthe Catskills in the blue distance beyond. The snort of a steampipe, and\\nperfume of grease and smoke, announced the vicinity of our locomotive;\\nand, as if to show off its paces, the engineer whirled the hideous thing\\nback and forth before our—at least my—nil admirari eyes.{26} Our horses\\nwere unhitched—the engine attached, and away we rushed, leaving our\\nfine steeds gazing after us with tears in their eyes, to see themselves\\noutdone by a great tea-kettle.',\n"," 'There are many pretty villas along the road; breathing places for the\\nheated citizens below, which I would describe to you; but dashing along\\nat sixteen miles an hour speed I can only catch a glimpse of white\\npillar and portico when the next minute we are three miles away. You\\nmust expect no description of the country when I am on a rail road, for\\nthe scenery is all blurred, like a bad lithograph. I only saw groups of\\npine trees rushing past and several bright dots which I suppose meant\\nwild flowers when we came in sight of Schenectady, an antique dutch\\ntown. Before entering it I was struck by the vision of two immense\\ntarred ropes walking deliberately beside our car, and discovered we were\\nupon an inclined plain, descending which, cars of stone were brought up\\nat the other end of our ropes. Our steam horse was once more exchanged\\nfor one of flesh and we set off upon a jog trot. Near the city we passed\\na canal basin in which lay several canal boats, for the Erie Canal\\npasses through here. We entered the city, crossed the end of a long\\nstreet filled with bright looking shops, where people and horses were\\nfrisking about in the morning air,—when another large depot received us\\nin its barn-like expanse. The Ballston and Saratoga train entered at the\\nother end, and you may imagine the charming confusion as the people of\\nboth trains jumped in and out the carriages, marched and counter marched\\nuntil they had settled down into their several seats.{27}',\n"," 'We were not suffered long to look upon this pleasant picture, for at 9\\no’clock we were on our way to Utica.

There may be lovelier vallies in the world, but\\ncertainly not another like this, for it is unique in its kind. Imagine a\\nlong green valley covered with rich farms—through its centre a bright\\ntransparent river, having a rail road on one bank and a canal on the\\nother; while a range of hills frame in the picture on each side. So\\nstraight is this valley, that canal, river, and rail road run parallel,\\nand within sight of each other nearly all the way.',\n"," 'It was one of June’s sweetest mornings when we passed the shores of the\\npretty Mohawk, and I was never weary of gazing down into its smiling\\nface, as we glided along; or of watching the lazy canal boat dragging\\nits rich freight at the foot of those soft green hills opposite; or, of\\npeeping out the coach at the rugged cliffs, which reared their bare\\nheads far above our road.',\n"," 'There are many little villages on this route, where{28} we stopped to\\nrefresh ourselves, or to fill the engine. The first was Amsterdam a\\nsmall Dutch settlement. Near this place stands a handsome stone edifice\\nwhich is renowned in the annals of New York as the residence of Grey\\nJohnson and his brother Sir William, the dreamer. At these towns there\\nare hotels, and at other spots refreshment houses, built at the road\\nside, where you are allowed a few minutes to rest. You are shown into\\nlarge rooms set out with long narrow tables, bearing loads of coffee,\\noysters, cakes, pies, fruit lemonade, etc.,—you pile your plate with\\ngood things, stir around your coffee or tea, when tingle! goes the bell\\n‘all aboard!’ rings in your ears, and you have just time to put your 25\\ncents into the attendants hands and yourself in a car when puff! and\\naway you go. Some of these towns are pretty, as St Johns, Fonda,\\nCanajoharie, Herkimer, and many others.—What hungry people these\\ntravellers are! at every refreshment station the tables were crowded and\\nat the signal they rushed into the cars each with a cake or pie, or\\napple, to finish at his leisure.

The little falls of the Mohawk is a\\ndelightful place. The river here forces its way through a rocky country\\nand falls over successive ledges of rock in pretty cascades. The beauty\\nof the scene does{29} not consist in altitude, but in number and variety of\\nthese saults; and the foaming river rushing over its rocky bottom or\\nwinding around its tiney islets, and in the towering cliffs around it.\\nThe village is seated upon each side of the river, connected by a\\nhandsome marble aqueduct leading to the canal basin, and by a neat\\nbridge for carriages. The scene as we approached was very pretty.

How it came to wear through these\\nhills and run away to the sea no one can ever know. The rocks here are\\nlimestone, principally; but I observed there was with it some fine\\ngranite. There was an old man among our passengers, who had lived here\\n‘when all this was a wilderness.’ He amused us with some stories of past\\ntimes; one of which I think interesting enough to tell you. Here it is\\nto fill up the page.',\n"," 'During the War of Independence there were two brothers, who, although\\nthey were brothers, could not think alike; they joined opposite sides in\\nthe war. It happened while the Division under Gen. Herkimer was\\ndestitute of arms, ammunition and clothing, he heard of the approach of\\nthe English troops. Fight he could not; fly he would not; and he was\\nseeking some stratagem to better his situation, when fortunately, for\\nhim, the English brother having strayed too near his camp was taken up\\nas a spy. The brothers, who had been long separated met once more; but\\nit was a bitter meeting, for one was a prisoner and condemned to die. In\\nspite of their different sentiments they loved each other. The prisoner\\nearnestly entreated his brother, who was the General’s Aid, to use all\\nthe influence in his power to save his life. The Aid was conscious he\\ncould not succeed unless he made the ‘worse appear the better reason;’\\nfor his brother had been fairly captured as a spy, and in consequence of\\nsome bloody deeds of the enemy, his life was to be forfeited. With a\\nheavy heart and darkened brow he entered the General’s tent.',\n"," '‘I know what you would ask ere you speak’ said his commander. ‘I have\\nexpected you and have de{31}termined upon my course. You come to ask your\\nbrother’s life—it is your’s upon one condition.’ ‘Name it! I am not\\nafraid to agree to any thing my General may propose!’ ‘I require you to\\ngo over to the enemy as a deserter—tell them exactly of our numbers;\\nfor I have learnt they do not imagine we are so strong; conceal the\\nstate of our arms and provisions; and if I am not much mistaken, they\\nwill immediately withdraw when they know how large is our force. You are\\nthen to find your way back again as you can. When you return your\\nbrother shall be free.’',\n"," 'For one moment the Aid hesitated. To appear as a deserter—to act the\\nspy—to deceive even an enemy, was adverse to his open noble\\nnature—there was also danger of discovery when returning, which would\\nlead to disgrace and death.',\n"," '‘Well young man! what is your determination?’ asked the General. ‘I will\\ngo, and trust in heaven and in you.’ He sought the enemy’s camp, was\\nimprisoned as a spy—but his feigned tale procured his liberation. The\\nenemy retreated before so large a force, which they could have conquered\\nif they had known their distressed condition. It was many months ere the\\nAid rejoined his General. His brother was released, and after a parting\\nfull of sorrow they separated never to meet again.',\n"," 'We arrived at Utica at three o’clock, and repaired immediately to\\nBaggs’s hotel. Here we found an excellent dinner, just ready, which to\\nhungry travellers is a cheering sight. As I promised to put down our\\nexpenses, we pay $3,75 each, from Albany to Utica, eighty miles. We here\\nconcluded to leave the train,{32} and spend a few days at the celebrated\\nTrenton falls. After partaking a very nice dinner at Bagg’s hotel, we\\nentered a neat carriage for Trenton falls, 14 miles north of Utica. The\\ndrive is a pretty one, and up hill all the way. We arrived at dark at a\\nsmall inn in a forest, and were obliged to defer our visit to the\\ncascade until the next morning.',\n"," 'After breakfast we walked out to visit the falls. Our way was through a\\ndeep forest breathing forth sweet fragrance in the early morning air.\\nSuddenly, in the midst of the woods, we found ourselves upon the brink\\nof a precipice, one side of a narrow chasm two hundred feet deep, while,\\ntoo far below to be heard, a mountain torrent was rushing and foaming\\nover the rock. A range of five ladder stairways led down the steep,—and\\nas we thus hung over the water, we felt very much like some of\\nShakespear’s samphire gatherers, and thought what a ‘dreadful trade’ was\\nhunting waterfalls. Safely down, we found a narrow ravine, so filled\\nwith the roaring torrent, that there was scarcely room for a pathway\\nbeside it. Part of the way a chain was inserted into the rock that we\\nmight, by holding upon it, pass the boiling whirlpool, if our nerves are\\nstrong enough to command our hands and feet—so scrambling, climbing,\\nswinging, we contrived to reach the uppermost cascade, which is two\\nmiles from the last one. This stream, called the West Canada Creek,\\nfalls down a deep ravine over successive ledges of rock, in six small\\ncascades of great beauty. The highest is only fifty feet high. The sides\\nof the ravine are precipitous, and covered with the beautiful foliage of\\nnumerous trees. Among them are many evergreen trees—of these I remarked\\nthe{33} stately white pine, which grows over one hundred feet high and\\nperfectly straight; the red pine, with its dark green leaves, and yellow\\ncones; the black spruce and the lofty birch. The rocks are slate and\\ntransition lime stone of the silurian series, abounding with\\npetrifaction, of which many are perfect trilobites. Quartz crystals are\\nalso found here in great beauty and profusion. This place has been the\\nscene of some tragic events—one of them most pitiable. A young girl sat\\nout upon a pleasure tour, accompanied by her mother, father, and\\naffianced husband. They came to this place, no warning spirit pressing\\nthem back, no drear omen warning them away, and no dream or presentment\\nchecking their steps. Gaily they descended the stairs, and clambered the\\nrocks—the lover with the hand of his betrothed in his; the father and\\nmother behind. Being thus led along, did not accord with her playful\\nspirit, and telling him she could take care of herself, she in an evil\\nmoment withdrew her hand. His charge to be careful was answered by\\nsmiling asseverations of her sure-footedness; he turned with another\\nadmonition and she was gone! Where is she? He looks in every direction.\\nShe has hid herself in play; he calls; no answer but the torrents roar;\\nshe has rejoined her parents; he turns towards them and sees them\\nquietly reposing together upon a rock. His pallid look—his wildness, as\\nrooted to the spot, he gazes upon them, tells them the tale of woe, soon\\nbitterly confirmed by her pretty bonnet of straw, which was at that\\nmoment whirled past their feet. Oh, the agony of those hearts as they\\nstood beside that dark torrent, away from all help, and powerless to\\nsave their beloved one. The guide was des{34}patched to the village for\\nhelp, but not until three days after was she found a mile below; her\\ntender form having been thus far carried over rocks and whirlpools.',\n"," 'Another family party came to view these scenes. A tender girl of eleven\\nyears was for security consigned to the valet’s arms. One false step\\nplunged him into the torrent—he struggled to the shore, but the\\nparent’s pretty fondling was lost to them in life. The body was the next\\nday found.',\n"," 'As I stood upon the slippery rock, while these events were floating\\nthrough my memory, their scenes pointed out to me by the guide; the\\nplace lost all its beauty, and the dashing torrent seemed some huge\\nmonster, seeking whom he might suck beneath his horrid depths. I grew\\nnervous, and much to my companions surprise, begged him to return. He,\\nrejoicing in the fresh country air, and released from the city’s dust,\\nran over the rocks with, to me, an alarming quickness, and I turned to\\ndepart. Why these beloved ones should be thus snatched away from their\\nfond relatives; taken from their homes to find their death in this wild\\nspot, is to us unknown. He who commanded this, has purposes, to us\\nunscrutable; perhaps it was to read a lesson to those who hear the tale,\\nto teach them the uncertain hold they have upon life, and all its\\npleasures, and to fear that power which can in an unlooked for moment,\\nbear them from life to eternity. There are hundreds every season who\\nstand upon this spot, and hear this story, and the heart which is not\\naffected by it must be as the hearts of the petrified animals around\\nthem.{35}',\n"," 'We spent several days here, riding and walking among the romantic\\nscenery.',\n"," 'The village of Trenton Falls is a small one, containing a few shops, and\\ncottages and two churches, one of which is quite pretty. The ride\\ntowards Utica is very beautiful. The ground descends on each side to the\\nMohawk valley, and while our road wound down this side, we had the whole\\nslope of the other side before our eyes, covered with orchards and\\nfields, and dotted with villages. The town of Clinton with Hamilton\\ncollege, stands upon elevated ground, while, below, at the river’s brink\\nis spread the city of Utica. Here we spent a day looking about its\\nstreets and shops. The ground slopes down to the river, near which are\\nthe business streets, while most of the dwelling houses are upon the\\nmore airy and elevated portion of the city. Genessee street is a fine\\nwide avenue leading up the hill, lined upon each side with shops,\\nhotels, churches, libraries, museums, &c. The canal is here crossed by a\\npretty bridge. The houses were substantially built, surrounded, many of\\nthem, by gardens, and appeared very comfortable residences. The business\\npart of the city show rows of well built ware-houses, and were filled\\nwith people and carts passing to and fro, as if their trade was an\\nactive one and their city thriving. The Erie canal has brought much\\ntrade to this place, which now is one of the most flourishing inland\\ntowns in the State. The canal boats, stages, and rail trains which are\\nconstantly arriving and departing give a stirring appearance to the\\nplace. Religion, education, and literature, engage the attention of the\\ninhabitants who support sixteen churches, and many seminaries and\\nliterary institu{36}tions. The population in 1835, was 10,183, to which now\\nof course, several thousands must be added. It is situated in Oneida\\nCounty, which was selected by the celebrated Baron Steuben as his\\nretreat, and here he was buried.',\n"," 'June 21st.—We left Utica to-day in the three o’clock train for\\nAuburn. About four miles from the city we passed a small town called\\nWhitesborough, a pretty place, with two churches, an academy, and a\\nbuilding called the Oneida Institute. There is also here a manual labor\\nschool. A large unfinished building just outside of Utica, we learned\\nwas to be a lunatic asylum, calculated to accommodate one thousand\\npatients—God pity them.',\n"," 'Several pretty towns lay upon our route: as Rome, Manlius, Canastola,\\netc. Sweet retreats from the confusion of a city without the solitude of\\nthe country.

Rome is a place of\\nconsiderable importance, containing five churches, a court house,\\nacademy, several shops and dwellings. The population, five years since,\\namounted to 4,800. When arrived at Syracuse we drove up to a large good\\nlooking stone building bearing the name of Syracuse House. There we\\nstopped to take tea. This place is sixty miles from Utica: enjoys\\nconsiderable trade, but is still in its teens, having arisen since the\\ncanal passed through that part of the country. The Oswego canal joins\\nthe Erie here, which, with the salt works near, brings them much\\nbusiness. The population is 7,000. We observed in passing through it,\\nseveral good churches,{37} a pretty court house, substantial ware houses,\\nnumerous shops and dwellings, with a lyceum and high school, so that it\\nwould seem the inhabitants ought to be wealthy, refined, and well\\neducated. The salt springs are at Salina, one mile and a half from\\nSyracuse, where there are eighty manufactories of this material. These\\nsalt springs flow from beds of slate, in some places two hundred feet\\nthick. Among the layers are masses of vermicular rock, whose interstices\\nare supposed once to have been filled with salt. In this region of\\ncountry are extensive gypsum beds; water lime is also found in\\nprofusion.

Onondaga lake with the pretty\\nvillage reposing upon its shore, and the rich fields around it, were all\\ntouched with this golden pencil. The fields were strewn with salt vats,\\nwhere the salt was undergoing evaporation, which were covered with low\\nsheds, probably taken off in the morning, as it was now late Saturday\\nafternoon, and this might have been to protect them from the weather. It\\nwas quite dark when we reached Auburn. We left the cars at the railroad\\ndepot, and were provided with carriages to the American Hotel.

The baptist and\\nseveral other churches struck us as very neat and tasteful. The\\nepiscopal is in the gothic style, the interior lined with oak, and\\ncontaining a handsome monument of Bishop Hobart, who died in this place.\\nThe hotels are showy handsome buildings, particularly the Auburn House,\\nand the American, where we have taken up our quarters.

We saw from here the Theological Seminary, several\\nhandsome churches, hotels, elegant private dwellings, and streets of\\nshops; while the outside of the circle presented a charming and varied\\nrange of fields, and hills, and groves and streams. It seemed indeed the\\nloveliest village of the plain around, and I expressed my surprise at\\nseeing so large and{39} well built a town ‘so far off.’ My companion told\\nme it was too near the commencement of our journey to be astonished yet,\\nI had Rochester, and Buffalo, and Cincinnati to see. This town has a\\npopulation of nearly 7,000, I do not know exactly, but refer you to the\\nGazetteers. Those of our friends whom we visited gave the place a fine\\ncharacter for good society, and told us they enjoyed all the\\nconveniences and elegances of life, with good pastors and good books. In\\ntwenty-four hours any thing can reach them from New York. The prison\\npresents an imposing appearance. It is built of dark stone with gothic\\nornaments, and consist of first, a high wall enclosing a large square,\\nin the centre of which, rises a massive pile of building surmounted by a\\ncupola. This building is arranged on three sides of a square, the centre\\n276, the other 242 feet long. In this are the eating rooms, hospital,\\nchapel, and cells. The work shops are erected against the wall leaving a\\nspace for the keeper to walk around and gaze upon them through holes for\\nthe purpose, himself unseen. It is a dismal life these poor creatures\\nlead, not only encarcerated from the world, but confined alone, and\\nforbidden even to speak to a fellow prisoner when they meet at table or\\nin the shops. They pass the life of La Trappe monks, except that it is\\nagainst their will. At table they sit in rows with their faces one way,\\nso that they cannot even see each other. However, this solitary and\\nsilent existence is said to be the best and most successful method of\\nrestraining and reforming the unhappy convict. In solitude they have\\ntime for reflection, and silence prevents corruption from their fellow\\ncriminals. They have religious instruction, which has con{40}verted\\nseveral. I cannot but think it a very efficient arrangement. The guilty\\nman is stopped in his mad career, and solitude, silence, and time for\\nreflection, and religious counsel, are blessings placed in his path. In\\nthe mean while his bodily wants are attended to, he is supplied with\\nnutritious food, well ventillated rooms, with nurses and physicians. He\\nis obliged to work, and the fruits of his labor go to defray the prison\\nexpenses. We saw carriages, shoes, cabinet-ware, and various other\\narticles made by them, offered for sale in the shops of the village.[1]{41}',\n"," '\\nJune 23d, 1840.\\n',\n"," 'Dear E.—At ten o’clock, we entered the stage coach for Rochester, 70\\nmiles distant. Among our passengers were two whom we had found extremely\\ninteresting, while journeying from Utica here—a clergyman of\\nMassachusetts and his daughter. The Rev. N. T——r, was about seventy,\\nbut extremely active, and very cheerful. His conversation was\\ninstructive and agreeable and of course in a pious vein, for he had\\noccupied the pulpit 47 years, as had his ancestors for 230 years back.\\nThere was such simplicity of heart about him, such piety, and kindness\\nof manner, joined with elevated thought and deep learning that we lent a\\ncharmed ear to his discourse, during the whole day.',\n"," 'Our route lay through an exquisitely beautiful country, covered with\\ncultivated farms and varied with pretty lakes and towns. The first lake\\nwe saw was Cayuga lake. It is from one to four miles broad, and\\nthirty-eight long. It is a bright sheet of water,{42} lying in a deep\\nvalley and from its surface its shores gently rise, covered with a fine\\nfarming country. We crossed the end of the lake over a bridge more than\\na mile long. So pure was the water that as we looked down upon it, we\\nplainly beheld the trout swiming beneath.',\n"," 'Leaving the lake we passed through the pretty villages of Waterloo and\\nSeneca Falls. Here the dark green Seneca river rushes foaming over a bed\\nof rock, in a fall of forty seven feet. There are several mills and\\nmanufactories upon its borders, and we observed several churches, an\\nacademy, and many shops. Seneca! fair Seneca Lake, how can I describe\\nthe gentle beauties of thy varied shores, and of that pretty town which\\nso adorns thy banks. This lake and its surrounding country, present a\\nvery lovely scene. There is nothing grand about the lakelet; you must\\nnot imagine it enclosed in the moutains of lakes George or Champlain;\\nthe style is petite and delicate. Its Indian name was Jensequa, which\\nhas been modernised into its present appellation. It is a placid,\\ntransparent sheet of water, of very great depth, 4 miles by 35 long, and\\nis said never to be frozen over in the coldest winter. The road lay\\naround the end of the lake, from whence the eye wound over its fair\\npellucid waters to its cultivated shores, adorned with handsome\\nfarm-houses, and country seats, and the massive buldings of the college\\nwhich occupies a commanding elevation near the town—and the towers and\\nsteeples of the village peeping through the trees, as if to catch a\\nglimpse of the waters below. We stopped at a small stage house in the\\nlower and business end of the town, where we all {43}descended from the\\nstage while the operation of changing horses and stages was going on. A\\ngood sized parlor furnished with gay landscape paper received the female\\npart of the passengers, while the restless mankind part, repaired to\\nthe shops, to inspect the manufactures of the town, or to refresh\\nthemselves at the soda-water, and ice-cream shops. Once more seated in\\nour stage coach we ascended the hill, to the better portion of the town,\\nwhere we passed through the principal avenue of the place, upon each\\nside of which were arranged those pretty villas and gardens for which\\nGeneva is so justly celebrated. There were several churches in view, and\\na new presbyterian half built. This, to us, was an interesting object, a\\ntoken God was not forgotten by the busy people below, or the wealthy\\nones around us.',\n"," 'Canandaigua with its lake and street of villas received our\\ncommendations. There we dined at a very pretty and commodious Hotel,\\nhaving a fine view of the lake from its windows. Some of the lake trout\\nwhich appeared upon the table we found very fine. This lake is smaller\\nthan those we have passed being 14 miles long. The main street is nearly\\ntwo miles long, and we drove through a mile of tasteful ‘garden-houses,’\\nsurrounded by grounds laid out in a pleasing manner, adorned with\\nflowers and fine shade trees. The country from thence to Rochester is\\nvery beautiful. Spotted with farms and villages, and woodlands covered\\nwith groves of maple, hickory, bass-wood, elm, and evergreen trees. It\\nwas nearly dark around us, when we were told the city was in view, and\\nagainst the bright evening sky we beheld in the distance the towers and\\nspires of Rochester. When we arrived we{44} drove to the Rochester House.\\nAfter some refreshment we bade our companions adieu; promising to meet\\nat an early hour the next morning and drive over the town before we left\\nit for Lockport—and then were glad to rest, for we had come a long\\nday’s journey and in spite of good roads and commodious coaches, fine\\nspirited horses, and good drivers, we were very much fatigued.',\n"," 'Well do the inspired writers compare man and his brief existence to a\\nflower that early withereth—to a shadow—a cloud that quickly\\nvanisheth—one day here, and the next gone. Truly saith Job, ‘thine eyes\\nare upon me and and I am not,’ a just figure of man’s fleeting life.\\nNever have I found the truth of these comparisons more striking than at\\nthe present moment. I told you of the amiable intellectual clergyman,\\nwho with his daughter agreed to meet us early this morning—when that\\nmorning came he was in eternity! At two o’clock last night we were\\naroused by a messenger from Miss T. saying her father was very ill. We\\nfollowed the servant through the dark and lonely halls into the chamber\\nwhere ‘the good man met his fate.’ Yes, all was over. Around the room in\\nattitudes of mournful musing sat the keeper of the Hotel, some servants,\\nand several ladies who had arisen to do all in their power to soothe the\\nsufferer’s pains. All had been done that was possible, but in vain. Upon\\nthe bed, lay a silent corpse, whose countenance bespoke a death of\\nagony—it was all that now remained of that good and kind old man, that\\ntender father, whose refined manners and intellectual conversation, had\\ncharmed us so much the day before. But his high intellect, his talents,\\nhis agreeable converse, of what{45} avail were they all to him now, had\\nthey not been joined to deep heart-felt piety, and been devoted to the\\ninterests of religion. He had died far from his home, with no friends\\nnear him except his daughter—his last hour passed away in a hotel among\\nstrangers—yet spare your sympathy, for he died happy. The everlasting\\narms were supporting him, a tender father was waiting to receive him in\\nthose heavenly mansions where death and sorrow can never come. He was\\ngoing to no unknown region, he was to meet no stranger face, for his\\nmind and his heart had ever been familiar with that celestial home, now\\nto be his eternally—he knew a welcome awaited him from that Savior and\\nthat God, with whose spirit he had ever held communion through a long\\nlife spent in devotion and in acts of beneficence. It was the wish of\\nthe celebrated Archbishop Leighton that he might die at an inn, thus to\\nbe more forcibly reminded he was a pilgrim upon the earth—his wish was\\nfulfilled, for he died at the Bell Inn, London.',\n"," 'With what terms of praise high enough shall I speak of the people of\\nRochester. When the news of this sad event spread, they surrounded the\\nbereaved daughter with sympathizing hearts, and offers of service. The\\npersons belonging to the house, and the boarders, with many physicians\\nand clergymen with ther families, were anxious to cheer the heart of the\\nsad survivor, and to lighten her mournful duties. The services of the\\nEpiscopal church were read over the body by the Rev. Mr. W. a young\\nEnglish clegyman of great talent and piety. The persons assembled near,\\nseemed much affected with this solemn event. May God bless this sudden\\nprovidence to them{46} and to us. Uniting in a procession we accompanied\\nthe corpse to the canal boat, where bidding adieu to Miss T. we left her\\nto pursue her dreary journey of five hundred miles, accompanied only\\nwith hired attendants. With what comfort did we see in her the power of\\nreligion elevating the soul above the trials and sorrows of life.\\nNothing else could have supported this bereaved daughter through so\\nheart-rending a dispensation. But she knew in whom she believed. She saw\\nfrom whom the blow came, and her faith told her it was done in mercy. As\\nwe were to leave Rochester the next morning, some of our kind friends\\ncalled that afternoon and insisted upon driving us through the town. It\\nbeing our only chance of seeing this celebrated city, we accepted their\\nkindness, although the scenes of the morning had unfitted us for\\nanything but retirement.',\n"," 'As we drove along we were astonished at the extent and beauty of this\\ncity. It was you know founded in 1812, and now contains 22,000\\ninhabitants. We had heard of its rapid rise, but supposed it must\\nconsist mostly of wooden buildings as is often the case in new\\nsettlements, and our surprise was the greater to find it built in the\\nmost solid manner. Churches, houses, hotels and banks, court house and\\narcade, markets were all of marble or stone. There are here fourteen\\nchurches[2] some of them quite handsome. The Episcopal Church of St.\\nPaul’s, is a fine gothic edifice of grey stone—the church which enjoys\\nthe ministration of the Rev. Mr. W. mentioned above, is also handsome,\\nof gothic form, neatly edged with brown free stone—the pres{47}byterian is\\nof grey plaster supported by substantial abutments—the baptist, where\\nMr. C. officiates, one of our active friends of the morning; a neat\\nbrick edifice—also catholic, methodist and bethel for the canal men.\\nThe streets are many of them McAdamized. There is a fine park here\\nsurrounded by neat railings where the children of the neighborhood are\\nbrought to take exercise. But what most elicited our admiration were the\\nprivate dwellings, which in number and beauty are seldom equalled in our\\ncities. They are spacious, built of marble or stone, in gothic or\\ngrecian form surrounded by wings and piazzas, and out-buildings and\\ngrounds handsomely laid out, adorned with shade trees, shrubbery and\\nflowers. They are delightful retreats from the city’s dust and noise;\\nmake fine playgrounds for the children, and altogether evince much taste\\nand wealth. How much better is it for men of fortune, to secure for\\nthemselves and families, pure air and room for exercise, instead of\\nsqueezing, as they do in our city, into houses only 30 by 100 feet, as\\nis too much the custom in our cities. The wealth lavished upon gay\\nentertainments would procure space where their children might gain\\nhealth and strength. A frolic upon the green sward is much more\\nconducive to health, than a sober city walk beside a nurse. I often see\\nthese palid pitiable little creatures in our streets walking as gravely\\nand demurely as some old octogenarian. A child without gaiety is as\\ncheerless as a landscape without sun.',\n"," 'The Genesee river divides the city into two parts, and is crossed by\\nthree bridges and the two aqueducts of the Erie canal. The oldest of\\nthese is a very fine piece of hewn stone work 804 feet long supported by\\neleven raches. They were building another aqueduct, which{48} is 858 feet\\nlong and 28 in height[3], and the music of the rushing river was almost\\ndrowned by the mason’s hammer.',\n"," 'Beside this canal there is another called the Genesee valley canal from\\nRochester to Olean, 119 miles. The Genesee falls are very pretty,\\nconsisting of rapids through the city, and in the suburbs it plunges\\nover a circular rock into a deep dell. The whole fall through the city\\nis 268 feet; 97 at the cascade. There is another cataract farther down\\nthe river, which falls 106 feet. This is at Carthage, two miles below,\\nand here is the port at which the lake steamboats stop. A rail road runs\\nto this place. There was not much water in the river, and we did not see\\nthe falls in their greatest perfection, but still there was great beauty\\nin the feathery foam which fell in snowy masses over the dark rock.\\nThese cliffs are old red stone and limestones—with feruginous sand\\nrock, and argillaceous iron ore; supposed by geologists to be equivalent\\nto the Caradoc series. Upon the summit of the cliff opposite to us was a\\nrange of solid stone mills, from whence we obtain that fine Genessee\\nflour, ground from the wheat in the fertile region around. Five hundred\\nthousand barrels of flour are turned out in a year. There are twenty-two\\nof these mills. The little streams which trickle down the rocks, are\\nstolen from the river to turn the wheels. Our kind friends were anxious\\nto drive us to Mount Hope, a celebrated cemetery a few miles from the\\ncity, but time was wanting for this and many other proposed pleasures. A\\ndistant view of Lake Ontario is said to be obtained{49} from this hill. We\\nreturned home through some of the business streets, which, particularly\\nMaine and Buffalo, were filled with busy people, waggons of home or\\nforeign produce, while the long ranges of shops were gay with dry goods\\nhanging from the doors, and piled with every comfort and luxury. Stages\\nwere landing or taking up passengers, canal boats were arriving and\\ndeparting and every thing we saw denoted a striving and thriving\\npopulation.{50}',\n"," '\\nJune 25th, 1840.\\n',\n"," 'Dear E.—We left Rochester this morning at eight o’clock, in a fine\\nstage and four horses, for Lockport, 64 miles distant, for which we were\\nto pay two dollars and fifty cents each, dinner on the road, included.\\nIt was with much regret that we parted from this interesting city, for,\\nalthough we had been there but a short time, we had seen enough to be\\nable to appreciate its beauties, and the sterling qualities of its\\nbeneficent and refined inhabitants. We passed through several pretty\\nvillages, and observed with pleasure the farm houses and even the\\nmeanest cabins were decorated with roses, geraniums, honey-suckles and\\nother flowers; a pleasing custom which I wish was more followed among\\nus. In one of the villages, I think its name was Greece, I observed a\\nneat grave yard enclosed in a handsome stone fence and iron railing,\\nwhere ‘the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,’ while around the tombs\\nthe kind hand of surviving friends had planted roses and drooping\\nwillows. A great part{51} of our way lay over the famous ridge road, an\\nelevation of ground about as wide as a common road formed of sand and\\nshells, and which is supposed once to have been the shore of Lake\\nOntario, now about ten miles distant. The ground has very much this\\nappearance as the land between us and the lake is much lower, and level,\\nwith marshy spots. It is in some places covered with a dense forest.\\nThere is one thing however, which struck me as singular, the land\\ndeclines the other side of the road also, in some places leaving a\\nnarrow ridge to ride upon, which is not the ordinary form of a lake\\nshore. Why may it not have been a public road, formed by that\\nindefatigable race of diggers, the mound builders, as a thoroughfare\\nbetween two of their cities. It might still have been the border of the\\nlake, but swampy and marshy ground. If we are to believe Mr.\\nDelafield[4] these people were the descendants of the builders of Babel,\\nand when dispersed by the confusion of tongues wandered about the world\\nand at last found themselves in America. Here they have thrown up\\npyramidial mounds in imitation of their ruined tower on the plains of\\nShinar. The Arabs have a tradition that Nimrod, disappointed in his\\npurpose of reaching heaven by building a tower, constructed a chariot,\\nto which he placed a pair of wings, and thus hoped to enter the\\ncelestial regions. Alas! since the days of Nimrod how many like him,\\nhave sought to attain the courts above, by their own strenuous\\nexertions.',\n"," 'Dear me, how I have wandered from the ridge road. The celebrated\\ntraveller, McKenney, believes this to{52} have been the border of the lake,\\nwhich broke away and ran over the State of New York, thus scooping out\\nthe earth at the other side of the ridge. The lakes Geneva, Canandaigua,\\nCayuga, etc., he believes to have been left by this flood. This agrees\\nwith Dr. Mitchell’s theory of a vast lake having been once in this part\\nof the state, which burst through its southern shore at the Little Falls\\nof the Mohawk, and through the Highlands, flooding the coasts of New\\nYork with alluvion. De Witt Clinton also, in his Canal report, remarks:\\n‘The general position of the Little Falls, indicate the former existence\\nof a great lake above connected with the Oneida lake; as the waters\\nforced a passage here and receded, the flats were formed above, composed\\nof several acres of alluvion.’ In this alluvion trees are often found\\ntwelve feet under ground. Darby observed marks upon the rocks at Little\\nFalls fifty feet above the river, showing the water had once stood so\\nhigh.',\n"," 'At a distance we saw Brockport upon the canal, and soon after, at\\nGainesville, we dined. We reached Lockport at five o’clock in the\\nafternoon and were shown into a neat comfortable hotel where we awaited\\nthe time of starting in the cars. Lockport is a town of the mushroom\\norder, having arisen around the locks of the canal within a few years.\\nThe churches, houses, and hotels, looked very respectable, and the\\nrail-roads and canals gave it quite a stirring appearance. The locks at\\nthe canal here are a great curiosity. There are five double combined\\nlocks which carry the canal over the ridge. There is also a deep cutting\\nthrough the solid rock for some miles which is very interesting. Many\\nspecimens of minerals have been{53} discovered here, as carbonate of lime,\\nselenite, dogtooth spar, petrifactions, etc. I promised to give you an\\naccount of all our expenses, so I will mention now, we are to pay\\nninety-four cents each to Niagara, twenty miles, as I shall not think of\\nsuch mundane affairs while there. Our expenses at the hotels have been\\ntwo dollars a day each, and meals fifty cents each at all our stopping\\nplaces. Seated in the rail car we were soon on our road, and fast\\ndashing through a tolerably cultivated country, with several neat\\nmansions peeping through the trees. I trembled lest the land should\\nremain thus until we arrived at Niagara, for I could not bear to\\napproach it through petty villages and farms, but we soon left all\\ncultivation behind and found ourselves in a deep forest. While gliding\\nrapidly along, the engineer’s bell rang to scare some cow or other\\nanimal, as we thought, from the rail track. Several of the passengers\\nlooked out, one pronouncing it a man, another a cow, until, as we\\napproached, we discovered it was an Indian female. She was enveloped in\\na dark mantle from beneath which could be seen her scarlet leggins\\nrichly embroidered with beads. With a slow and stately step she paced\\nthe rail-track, the engineer’s bell and shrill whistle unheeded. That\\nshe heard them was evident, for another Indian woman, her companion, who\\nwalked outside the rail, stretched forth her hand as if in earnest\\nappeal, but the haughty young princess scorned to fly before her\\ncountry’s foe. The engine with slackened speed came near her and\\nstopped; then, and not until it had quite stopped, she condescended to\\nwalk off the rail-way. As we passed I saw she was young and pretty, and\\nher dark eye flashed with a{54} triumphant expression which said, ‘You\\ndared not drive over me! I scorned to be forced from the road by your\\nbell, like an animal!’',\n"," '‘Look out for the Falls! Prepare for Niagara!’ is the cry of all in the\\ncoach. My heart began to beat—does not yours? Do be a little romantic,\\nand feel some emotion, while about to behold one of Nature’s greatest\\nwonders. I looked out; we were on the river’s bank, a high precipice of\\nabout two hundred feet Far below rushed the river, of a green copper\\nhue, or verdigris; far up through the defile I caught a view of a\\nmountain of mist, but I resolutely turned away, for such snatches of\\nviews I have been told to avoid, as bringing disappointment with them.\\nThe road swerved from the river, and in a few minutes we found ourselves\\nin the midst of the little village of Niagara. When the train stopped we\\nwere surrounded by a host of porters, struggling to secure us for their\\nseveral favorite hotels. We chose the Cataract house, from a friend’s\\nrecommendation, and from its appropriate name. We had no cause to repent\\nour decision as its accommodation and attendance were every thing we\\ncould wish. We were shown into a neat chamber, which to my delight\\nlooked out upon the rushing rapids. The tea bell rang as we entered, and\\nmuch to the annoyance of my impatient spirit, my companion made it plain\\nto me I should refresh myself before visiting the Falls. Tea over, I had\\nleave to go, and we were soon upon the pathway. Shall I take you at once\\ninto the presence chamber of the divinity, or shall I describe the halls\\nand corridors as I pass through them to her throne? I think a minute\\ndescription will best please you. Niagara river, just{55} before it reaches\\nthe fall is divided into two parts; one rushing past the Canada shore,\\nplunges over the rocks making the crescent, or horse-shoe fall—this\\nfall is about one hundred and sixty feet high. The other half of the\\nriver passes around an island, called Goat, or Iris island, and falls\\nfrom the American side. This island has been sacred from the foot of man\\nuntil a few years since, when a bridge was thrown across the rapids with\\nmuch dexterity and daring. Upon this bridge we will walk if you please,\\nstopping one moment to view the rapids. These constitute a very\\nbeautiful feature of the scene, and, were it not for the falls, would be\\nwell worth a visit on their own account. The river is a mile wide, and\\ncomes rushing and foaming over rocks some ten or twelve feet high,\\nlooking, sea-faring men tell us, very much like breakers, or a sea in a\\nstorm—the green waves heightening the illusion. One is glad to be\\nsafely over this tumultuous water, especially as the former bridge has\\nbeen carried away. From the bridge you land upon Bath island, containing\\nabout two acres of land, upon which is erected a toll-house, and shop\\nfor the sale of Indian curiosities and canes. There are also bathing\\nhouses here. A short bridge brings us to Goat Island, one-half a mile\\nlong and a quarter wide. It is also called Iris, and as such I shall\\ndesignate it. The increased roar, the mist rising above the trees, urge\\nyou on, and you pass the ‘curiosity shop’ and refreshments here offered,\\nand hasten on through many a winding forest path, until you gain the\\nopposite side of the island, where you find yourself upon the brink of a\\ndeep gulf into which an ocean broken loose from its bounds is\\nprecipitated with astounding noise and violence!....{56} This is the\\ncrescent fall on the Canadian shore. But linger not here. Descend the\\nisland to the brink of the river, and cross the rapids over a tottering,\\nfrail bridge, to the tower, which stands upon the precipice at the edge\\nof the falls. Ascend to the top, and lean over the railing, look calmly\\ndown if you can, into the fathomless abyss of ocean, where the waves are\\ndashing; the foam whirling, and the winds rushing, amid the roar of a\\nthousand thunders eternally ascending. Deafened, confounded, bewildered,\\nyou retreat in haste, fearful every moment the breakers which are\\ndashing against the tower, will tear it away from its foundation, and\\nplunge you into the fearful ocean depths below. At this place, and upon\\ntable rock opposite, you see Niagara in all its power and terror. But if\\nyou would behold it in all its ravishing beauty, you must go as we did,\\nthe next morning before sunrise, and view it from the ferry house. To\\nreach this spot, you do not cross to Iris island, but follow the river\\nbank to the American fall, near which is the ferryman’s cottage, and at\\na little distance the ladder which leads you down to the boat. Seated\\nupon a rock, in front of the cottage, we feasted our eyes with unearthly\\nbeauty. Beside you is the American fall, tinged with a delicate apple or\\nberyl green hue. One delights to follow with the eye this fair\\ntranslucent arch, as it plunges far down into the water nearly two\\nhundred feet below us. You have but a sideling view of this fall here.\\nLooking past it you see the dark foliage of Iris island, and beyond, the\\nCanadian fall. This immense mass of water falls over rocks in the form\\nof a crescent, and is tinted with an elysian loveliness which you have\\nnever beheld, and never can{57} conceive, let me write pages upon it. Earth\\nhas never produced water of the like hue: something of the emerald, but\\nmore rich, more vivid. This green, spotted, and embroidered as it is,\\nwith wreaths of snow white foam, presents the most charming and unique\\neffect imaginable. In some places the water pitches over perfectly\\nsmooth, as if an emerald arch; and so pellucid, that you may distinctly\\nsee through it the white foam that is churned from the rocks over which\\nit flows. As we reached the spot from whence this is seen, the sun arose\\nabove the trees, and immediately two glorious rainbows spanned the river\\nfrom shore to shore! and the mist which was rising high in the air, took\\nthe tint of the rose, which faded, only to be replaced by the most\\ngorgeous prismatic hues. Never had imagination pictured any thing so\\nglorious as that scene: a tremendous fall of green and white water; a\\ngay colored rainbow; rosy mist; azure sky, and shores of various shades.\\nIt was a creation which belonged not to earth. It seemed as if the\\ncelestial city was before us, with its gates and walls of sapphire, of\\nemerald, of ruby, and of gold. The waters of life that flow through the\\ncity of God, seemed rushing past us, for the scene was altogether\\nunearthly, and our feelings were elevated to that sublime architect, who\\ncould create such surpassing beauty. Earth and its cares, home and its\\njoys are all forgotten, and we feel as if we could ever recline before\\nthe throne of that mysterious presence, and watch untiring those clouds\\nof incense which are rising before it forever. When we left the scene,\\nwe trod in solemn silence, as if on holy ground. The violence with which\\nthe water pours over the rocks has worn them away,{58} and the river has\\nbroken its way up from Lake Ontario at the rate of a rood in three\\nyears. It is supposed, when first discovered, to have been near the\\nClifton House on the Canadian shore, and the ferry house at the\\nAmerican.',\n"," 'June 26th.—This morning we descended the cliffs by a staircase and\\ncrossed to the Canadian shore. The boat was tossed about like a shell\\nupon the whirling waves, and as they looked up at the mass of water\\ntumbling so near them, and at the boiling water two hundred and fifty\\nfeet deep, under us, some of our fellow passengers became a little\\nnervous. My whole soul was so absorbed in contemplating the wondrous\\nscene, that I felt no terror. A sentinel in the scotch costume greeted\\nour eyes when we landed telling us we were now in a strange land among\\nanother people. A winding walk up the cliff, leads you to Clifton House,\\na celebrated Canadian hotel. From the balconies of this house, is one of\\nthe most imposing views of the Niagara falls. You see the whole at once,\\nwhile from the American side you see only a part at a time. Still, if\\nnot so grand, the view is more varied and more beautiful upon the\\nopposite shore and from Iris Island. Every one says it is ridiculous to\\nattempt to describe these falls, but, I have promised to give you\\ndaguerreotype views, and will endeavor to sketch the outlines—the\\nshading, and the impressions of the scene can only be given by the\\nplace itself. Imagine a crescent of water a mile long, plunging with\\nawful violence as if the foundations of the great deep had broken up\\nagain, from a cliff nearly 200 feet high. According to McKenney\\n15,000,000 tons of water{59} are poured over the rocks in 24 hours. A green\\nisland divides this fall into two unequal parts. Table rock, upon the\\nCanadian shore is at the edge of the falls, and projects over the cliff\\nwhere you may stand with nothing between you and the boiling ocean\\nbelow. So close is it to the water that the waves wash over part of it,\\nand it is almost always covered with mist and spray. If it be glory to\\nbe buried in Niagara, you may here hope for that fate, as a portion of\\nthe rock has already fallen, and a large crack shows you the remainder\\nwill soon follow. From this spot, is said to be the finest view, as the\\neye embraces the whole circle of waters; but, as it was one of the days\\nwhen the mist takes that direction, I saw but little of this. I found\\nmyself upon a slippery rock, a shelf between heaven and earth, with\\nwaves of spray breaking over me, and a furious mist dashing into my\\nface—a noise of waters was in my ears, a white foam rushed wildly past,\\nand I felt as if caught up in the sky in a whirlwind and driving snow\\nstorm. We waded back through the wet grass and ran into the Pavilion to\\navoid the spray dripping from the eaves. This house besides being a\\ncuriosity shop is the residence of the guide who will conduct you down a\\nlong staircase, and behind the fall if you wish—as I had no penchant\\nfor being drenched, half drowned and suffocated I did not attempt this\\nexploit. We descended this morning the American side and ventured a\\nlittle behind that fall. One feels very much as an Israelite making his\\nexode, with a wall of water at his side ‘where the flood stood\\nupright.’',\n"," 'When once in, you see a glorious chamber with dome and walls of emerald\\nrendered transparent by{60} the morning sun. You might imagine yourself in\\none of those crystal caves where the sea nymphs congregate, beneath the\\narches of the sea. On the road from table rock to Clifton House, there\\nis another building where there is a fine museum containing 4,000\\nspecimens of Indian curiosities, animals, minerals &c., many of them\\nfrom that region. The trees about here are most of them evergreen. The\\nregular yellow pine grows here and the silver fir with its white lined\\nleaves and purple cones and the fan leaved larch growing 100 feet high.\\nThe rocks of Niagara are secondary limestone and sandstone, abounding\\nwith veins and nodules of various minerals—among them selenite,\\ncalcareous spar—petrifactions—tufa from the cave, and many others. I\\nbelieve I have sketched for you every thing regarding these\\nfalls—gigantesque phenomene as La Vaseur calls them. Still I do not\\nexpect to give you any idea of them, for no one who ever wrote, conveyed\\nan impression of the reality to me. I might make a pyramid of\\nexpletives, and when all the superbs beautiful’s, majestic’s and\\ntouching’s are expended, you will say when you come, ‘the half has never\\nbeen told me!’ Many have been disappointed here chiefly because the\\nscenery around the falls is not as imposing as they had imagined. Some\\nwould have a range of lofty mountains as a back scene; or a crest of\\nnaked rocks towering above the falls; but I fancy these are of the class\\nof contradictionists who make a respectable figure in conversation\\nmerely by opposing every thing. They thus obtain a hearing, are able to\\nenter into an argument, when no other means would gain them a listener.\\nHe who formed this imposing scene is a better judge{61} of the sublime and\\nbeautiful. A range of mountains would materially injure the effect, as\\nit would by contrast take away from the height of the water. The\\ncataract would be a secondary object, but seated as it is in a level\\nregion of country, it is the first object that strikes the eye—- a gem\\non natures forehead. There are many drives in this neighborhood to\\nvarious interesting places, such as springs, whirlpools, battlefields\\n&c. The parade ground is also a favorite place of resort. A regiment of\\n700 soldiers are reviewed upon the Canadian shore. We hired a carriage\\nat the Clifton House and after a short drive found ourselves upon a\\nbeautiful plain above the falls, surrounded by guard houses, and\\nbarracks. The plain was soon filled with soldiers, who came marching up\\nin separate detachments from every direction. They were tall fine formed\\nmen, all of one height dressed in the Scotch costume, consisting of the\\nshort plaid skirt, stockings laced with red, cap and a cloud of black\\nplumes. They were well drilled, and marched, counter-marched and went\\nthrough all their evolutions as one man. The dress is picturesque, but\\nmust be a cold one in these regions. A pantaloon over the naked knee, I\\nthink would be an improvement. I could see soldiers, although not as\\nwell drilled, at home, so I was glad to turn my course towards that\\nrolling flood below. From this plain is a fine view of the rapids above\\nthe cataract, and of Iris Island, which seems to have floated to the\\nbrink of the precipice, like one of the Mexican floating islands. We\\nspent the afternoon upon Iris island. In the little curiosity shop we\\nrefreshed ourselves with delicate white strawberries grown upon the\\nisland, covered{62} with rich cream. Here also we added to our stock of\\nIndian bags and moccasins. Among the articles in the shops at the\\nvillage I admired most a large living eagle which was chained to his\\nperch. His feathers were black and white, and his beak and claws yellow,\\nwith a ruff of grey about his neck. I pitied the poor captive as he\\nstood gazing sadly out apparently listening to the roar of the falls,\\nand longing to be at large in his native forest once more.',\n"," 'The village of Tuscarora Indians is sometimes visited, much against\\ntheir wishes however. The Indian nations have never lost the remembrance\\nof their former power, and their present degradation. They look upon us\\nas usurpers, who have wrested from them the land of their fathers, and\\nhave never forgiven us. They count themselves our prisoners, and are\\nindignant that we should come and gaze upon them in their fallen state\\nas objects of curiosity. Their village is built upon the high shore of\\nNiagara about eight miles below the falls, commanding a fine prospect of\\nthe river and lake. They are under the care of a missionary who has been\\nthe means of converting fifty out of the three hundred. This tribe once\\nbelonged to the confederacy of five nations, but came originally from\\nNorth Carolina, and are living upon the proceeds of the sale of their\\nland there and their trade. Some of them are prosperous, industrious\\nfarmers, while the women embroider beautifully, with beads and stained\\nporcupine quills, upon birch bark and deer skin. These they dispose of\\nat the shops, and to strangers at the Hotels. Upon these occasions, I am\\nstruck with the difference between this proud race and our own. A pedler\\nor travelling shopman{63} comes in, unpacks his wares, holds up every\\narticle, insists upon its worth and beauty, and urges you to buy—with\\nthe Indian it is otherwise. At our hotel, while ascending after dinner\\nto the dining room, one is struck by the sight of a row of dark beings\\nsitting upright upon the settees in the halls envelloped in cloaks of\\nscarlet or black, richly embroidered with beads or adorned by pieces of\\ntin cut in flowers and tacked on. Their eyes are fixed upon the ground,\\ntheir long hair falls over their faces, and an expression of profound\\nmelancholy sits upon every countenance. You stand before them and gaze\\nupon them, but silent, grave, and motionless they sit, like the band of\\nconscript fathers awaiting the approach of Attila. You at last ask,\\n‘Have you any moccasins!’ with a dignified motion they throw open their\\ncloaks, and their laps are filled with articles for sale. You ask the\\nprice—a low musical voice tells you the amount in a very foreign\\naccent, and that is all I could ever obtain from an Indian woman\\nalthough I made many efforts while at Niagara, and they can both speak\\nand understand English.',\n"," 'I never saw but one of them smile. I asked her what she had for sale in\\nher lap—she threw it open, and behold a pretty Indian cupid asleep in a\\nbirch cradle, swathed and bandaged in their peculiar fashion. Titania\\nwould have quarrelled for it. At my start of surprise and admiration, a\\nmoonbeam smile flashed over her face and then all was dark and gloomy as\\nbefore. The celebrated Timothy Flint tells us, ‘the Indians are a\\nmelancholy musing race; whatever emotion or excitement they feel, goes\\non in the inner man.’ So close an observer as he was, and living so\\nlong{64} among them, his views can be relied on as being correct. The\\nIndians have always been noted for their strong attachment to their\\nchildren, and a stranger among them has only to praise the papoose to\\nwin his way to the parents heart.',\n"," 'June 27th.—I could not have believed parting with Niagara would have\\ncaused such sorrow. The lofty, and celestial emotions which are produced\\nwhen in the presence of this one of God’s most beautiful creations you\\nare unwilling to lose. You feel ‘it is good to be here’—and you dread\\nto leave this holy ground to enter again into scenes which will do much\\nto efface these pure emotions. A glimpse of heaven has been vouchsafed\\nyou, and most reluctantly you return to earth again. Slowly we sat out\\nthis morning to take a last farewell. We had seen it in all its\\nbrightness and we now beheld it in a sombre hue. The heavens were\\novercast, the mist, once of a dazzling whiteness now took a dusky tint,\\nand hung over the cataract like a mourning veil. It was more in\\naccordance with my feelings than to have bade her adieu while she was\\nsmiling in the ‘bright garish eye of day’—one might fancy she was sad\\nat losing such true worshippers. But you cannot understand such feelings\\nnow, they no doubt seem ridiculous—come here, and you will experience\\nthe truth of such emotions. At two o’clock, soon after dinner, we sat\\nout on the rail road for Buffalo. The road for some time is laid along\\nthe river bank, and gives us a fine view of the islands, rapids, and\\nother objects of interest, as Fort Schlosser, and Chippewa,—and then a\\nlong low wooded island floating upon the bosom of the broad stream was{65}\\nshown, as Navy island, the head quarters of the Canadian revolutionist\\nin ’37 and ’38. The band have however now dispersed, and the island has\\nreturned to its parent, promising never to do so any more. It contains\\n700[5] acres of good land. The river now begins to expand from one mile\\nto eight, including Grand Island in the centre. This is twelve miles in\\nlength, and contains 17,384 acres of rich land and stately timber. A\\nneat village called White Haven stands upon its shore, containing among\\nother buildings, a steam saw mill which furnishes ship stuff from 20 to\\n70 feet in length. A fine situation, for such an establishment, as there\\nis plenty of the raw material for this manufacture in sight all around.',\n"," 'There are 15 or 20 islands between the falls and Lake Erie, some of them\\nvery pretty, adorned with clumps of maple, oak, or cedar. Upon one of\\nthem, Tonawanda isle, is a fine mansion with cultivated grounds and\\nfields around it. Our road lay through a village of the same name\\nsituated upon Tonawanda creek, a small place through which runs the Erie\\ncanal. We had sufficient time to survey the beauties of Rattle-snake\\nIsland at our leisure, for, when just opposite, a part of our engine\\ngave way, and we came to a sudden pause. The male passengers were soon\\nout, to discover the cause, and came back with a report that we could\\nproceed no farther, as the injury was very great. We were declared to be\\n‘in a pretty fix.’ A horse was procured from a house in sight, and a man\\nwas despatched upon it to Buffalo about eight miles distant. Many of the\\npassengers sat out to walk to Black rock 4 miles a head, where they\\ncould{66} procure carriages to take them to Buffalo. The rest of us\\nremained seated in the coaches, with a hot July sun streaming through\\nthe windows. What should we do—scold at the road, or the train, or the\\nengineers? No, an American never vexes himself about such things—he is\\ncalm and indifferent under every circumstance. Some of us fell to\\nreading, some to napping and some to rambling. We undertook the latter,\\nbut as we were only surrounded by ploughed fields soon returned to the\\ncoach, where I busied myself in writing the above. Pray read on if it is\\nonly to repay me for my sufferings those two hours in the heat. I think\\nI had better abuse this rail road a little, for it deserves it. Do not,\\nhowever, suppose I am vexed at being left thus ‘sitting on a rail!’ The\\niron is ripped up in several places, causing a jolt when we strike\\nagainst these land snags, and a man rides beside the engineer with a\\nhammer to nail them down. It is the worst rail road I ever travelled\\nover: however, as it is only used a few months in the year when Niagara\\nis fashionable, perhaps it may not yield sufficient profit to allow much\\nexpense upon it. Something is seen coming up the road—all heads are\\nout, and we hope to be released from our captive state—it turns out to\\nbe the return train which had been waiting for our engine and cars, and\\nnow has been obliged to take horses instead. As it was impossible to\\npass us, the passengers and their baggage were turned out, and placed in\\nour coaches, to the Niagara end of which their horses were fastened.\\nThey looked very sourly at us while this was passing, thinking perhaps\\nof the maxim of Pythagoras to his scholars—Do not remain in the\\nhighway. They wondered at us for sitting in{67} their highway, depriving\\nthem of their engine, and condemning them to the loss of a fine\\nafternoon at Niagara. Some of them perhaps might have been of that\\nwhisking class of tourists who intended to return the next morning\\nearly, and to them it would be quite a loss.',\n"," 'A joyous shout announced the appearance of our horses, and we were soon\\non our way again. We passed through Black Rock, a considerable village,\\nand then followed the Erie canal for some distance. The last two miles\\nwere upon the borders of Lake Erie which stretched away a mighty mass of\\ngreen waters, to the horizon. As this was our first view of our great\\n‘inland seas, we gazed upon it with much interest. There are many\\nhandsome villas in the vicinity of the town commanding fine views of the\\nlake and city; one of them, a large Gothic stone mansion, promises to be\\nquite an ornament to the country if ever finished. At Buffalo we drove\\nof course to the American Hotel, as its fame had reached us at home. It\\nis a large stone building, well kept, and elegantly furnished. The\\ndrawing room is as handsome as any in the country, and the dining room\\nis a large airy commodious apartment lighted with five large gilded\\nchandeliers. The staircases and halls are of oak covered with copper in\\nsome places—the bedrooms, private parlors, table and attendance as good\\nas we could find in our boasted city. There is here also a public room,\\nhired sometimes, for concerts and lectures, which is well lighted with\\nchandeliers and set round with green silk couches. In fact every thing\\nis good and neat.{68}',\n"," 'June 28th.—Sabbath morning—that blessed day of rest, given in mercy\\nas a moment of repose in the wearied journey of life to the ‘world’s\\ntired denizen!’ We felt its benefit, and rejoiced no stage horn could\\nhurry us onward, and no bell, save the ‘church going bell’, could summon\\nus forth. The presbyterian church is a plain building, but handsomely\\nfitted up inside, and very comfortable. Rev. Mr. Lord is the minister,\\nan able and pious man. We heard in the morning a very interesting\\ndiscourse from Mr. Stilwell of the American Bethel Union. He delivered\\nit in a Baptist church in which the Rev. Mr. Choules officiates when in\\nthe city. It is a neat, commodious building, the pews made of the native\\nblack walnut cushioned and lined with horse hair. A choir of good\\nsingers accompanied by instruments led the music. The society to which\\nMr. Stilwell belongs devotes itself to the sailor’s interest. The state\\nof the boatmen upon the Erie canal he reported to be very wretched.\\nThere are about 25,000 boatmen and sailors employed upon the canal and\\nin lake navigation, who were of the lowest and most worthless class of\\nmen; seeming inaccessible to all efforts for their reformation or\\nconversion. These, mixing with the lower population of Buffalo, and\\nother towns on their route, exerted a baneful influence. The Bethel\\nUnion attempted to send missionaries among them, but they were abused,\\ninsulted and almost discouraged. Still, as they felt it their duty,\\nthese self-denying men persevered every Sunday in addressing the men\\nalong the canal, and in presenting bibles and tracts. They soon began\\nhowever to have some hope, for when the canal closed last autumn there\\nwere only two men who had re{69}fused tracts, and only three who insulted\\nthem. With this success, small as it was, they were excited to go on,\\nhoping the Lord was smiling upon their labors. The minister most\\nsuccessful among them had once been a canal boy himself, and while\\nsitting upon his horse dragging the boat, employed himself for hours in\\ninventing new and strange oaths to surprise his fellow boatmen. The men\\nnow readily listened to him. They were conscious of their degradation,\\nknew they were despised by all good men, and never hoped to rise. Seeing\\nnow, one of their number so bright and shining a light, they trusted a\\nboatman’s name would not always be an object of scorn. These poor men\\ncomplained to him, that they had no day of rest, as there was as much\\nforwarding upon the Sabbath as upon any other day. The Captains of the\\nlake boats were also obliged to struggle against this evil, and in some\\ninstances had renounced their trade upon that account, or upon\\nremonstrance had been turned adrift for some less scrupulous Captain.\\nThe fault then seems to lie upon the forwarding merchants, whom Mr.\\nStillwell addressed, begging their forbearance in this respect.',\n"," 'It is to be hoped this address produced its intended effect, and the\\nmerchants who claim a day of repose for themselves, have granted the\\nsame to the unfortunate boatmen.[6]',\n"," 'June 29.—This morning we sent for a carriage and sat out to see the\\ncity and make some visits. Buffalo,{70} although suffering with all our\\ncities in the stagnation of trade, seems to be doing a great deal of\\nbusiness. The rows of shops, and handsome ware-houses, seem to contain\\nevery article necessary for comfort or luxury. It is a larger city than\\nRochester, but has not its air of elegance and neatness. The town was\\nburnt by their neighbors, the Canadians, in 1814, but has since been\\nrebuilt. The streets are wide and airy, Maine street, the principal\\navenue, is more than a mile in length. The churches are neat buildings,\\none of them, a catholic, promises, when finished, to be handsome. The\\ncourt house is a solid well built edifice having pillars up to the roof.\\nThe markets are very good also. The city is well situated upon ground\\nrising gently from the lake, the upper part being covered with handsome\\nprivate dwellings, which thus obtain fine views of the lake and\\nsurrounding country, and secure for themselves room for their gardens\\nwhich are very prettily laid out. There is here also a military station\\nfor the United States troops, whose barracks, comfortable brick\\nbuildings, are built around the parade ground and surrounded by a good\\nwall. Our friend’s cottage was upon elevated ground looking down upon\\nthe green Niagara river, and enjoying a view of the lake in front, and\\nbehind an extent of country covered with the untamed forest. It was the\\nfirst time I had seen a forest landscape, and I looked with much\\ninterest upon this vast plain of green leaves reaching to the distant\\nhorizon; a smoke curled in one spot telling of some settler clearing his\\nway through the green wood. The handsomest private dwellings here do not\\naffect the Gothic or Grecian, which had prevailed along our road, but\\nwere substan{71}tial square stone or brick buildings, having a marble\\nportico in front, an cupola upon the top, surrounded by a fancy railing.\\nOur drive around Buffalo was very interesting, and we wondered, as we\\nmarked such a mass of solid buildings, and depots of articles from every\\nregion in the world, and such throngs of human beings deposited in a\\nwilderness, but a few years redeemed from the Indian, the buffalo, and\\nthe bear. What industry, what energy, has been employed to bring hither\\nall these materials. Buffalo is a frontier town, and grand portal of the\\nwest, through which is flowing a constant stream of travellers and\\nemigrants. This mixture of all nations in the streets, give them an\\nunique appearance. Here you see the Indian beau with his tunic bound\\nwith a crimson sash, his hat surrounded by a circle of feathers; his\\ndeer skin pantaloons richly embroidered in barbaric patterns, while\\nribbons and tassels swing out from his dress at every step. After him\\nwill pass a band of United States soldiers; then a rough back-woodsman,\\nupon a horse looking as wild as himself, its uncut mane and tail waving\\nin the wind as he gallops violently through the streets. Then follows a\\nparty of comical German emigrants; a scarlet clad British officer; a\\nCanadian; a Frenchman; a wild looking son of Erin; a sturdy ruddy,\\ngaiter legged English farmer; a Tonawanda squaw with her papoose upon\\nher back; and lastly the dainty lady traveller with her foreign abigal,\\nand fantastically dressed children. Among the crowd I observed a curious\\nfigure—a one legged negro, wearing an old uniform coat with ruffled\\ncuffs, ringing a bell most energetically. The old English custom of\\nsending a bell-man to proclaim{72} the loss of any article, prevails here,\\nas in some of our other towns, I believe. ‘What is lost, Sambo?’\\ninquired a person. ‘Your wits, massa,’ he replied quickly, setting his\\njuvenile train off in a fit of laughter. To another inquirer, he\\nreplied, ‘My leg is lost, don’t you see’ holding up the stump. He is, I\\nsuppose a privileged wit, who, if he cannot set the table, no doubt\\ndoes the street in a roar. The Buffalonians are a gay social people.\\nThe unamiable fashion of exclusiveness being very little known here,\\nfor, living where the population is continually changing and where\\nstrangers are constantly claiming their hospitality, they have acquired\\nan easy unsouciant manner, and are ever forming social meetings to\\nentertain the stranger. Our letters procured for us much kind attention,\\nand we had an opportunity of witnessing this free hospitable spirit. In\\nthe afternoon one of our friends called, and we drove down where a\\nfanciful yacht awaited us, and a pleasant party of ladies and gentlemen,\\nfor the purpose of taking us over to the ruined fort opposite the city.\\nThis is a favorite picnic haunt of the young citizens. Fort Erie is upon\\nthe Canadian shore, opposite Buffalo, just at the point where the\\nNiagara river runs out of lake Erie. It was destroyed during the war of\\n1812.',\n"," 'I have scarcely enjoyed any thing so much as that sail over Lake Erie.\\nThe lake is here five or six miles broad. The water rushes swiftly past,\\nas if eager to accomplish its glorious destiny of plunging over the\\nrocks of Niagara, there to be a spectacle which nations come from afar\\nto gaze upon. We caught the excitement which seemed to animate the\\nwater, as we were tossed upon its wavelets with{73} quick, gay, tilting\\nmotion; and gazed with much delight at the novel objects around us. The\\ncity, with its numerous domes and spires; the bright Niagara rushing and\\ngurgling at a rapid rate over the ledge of rocks which once was Erie’s\\nbarrier ere the waters burst their bounds—the gulls wheeling above us,\\nor floating upon the waves; and above all, that immense lake, that\\nmighty mass of sparkling emerald water, stretching far into the\\nmysterious west. The air, breathing from the fresh forest and cool lake,\\nwas so refreshing that I was almost sorry when we reached the shore.\\nLanding upon a sandy beach, we repaired to the fort, where under the\\nshadow of a ruined wall, we seated ourselves upon the green sward, and\\nwhile refreshing ourselves with the contents of our provision baskets,\\nour discourse fell upon the hapless fate of those whose blood had dyed\\nthe fair turf around us; or upon other scenes which occurred during that\\nborder war. But now all this is over; conqueror and vanquished are both\\nbeneath the ‘clod of the valley’; the echo of the war trump has died\\naway; the green earth smiles again as peacefully as if it had never\\ndrank the blood of the dying, and wall, and bastion, are fast crumbling\\ninto their parent elements. The lake, the sky, the shore, are no longer\\nvexed with sights and sounds of strife. Alas! whence come wars and\\nfighting among us? Must these things always be? Must earth’s children\\never thus hack and tear each other? And we who are brethren, whose homes\\nare in sight upon either shore of this bright lake, can we not dwell in\\nunity? They who have opposite creeds, who differ in dress, in manner, in\\nlanguage, may and will rival, dislike, detest, fight and exterminate\\neach{74} other; but we, who are sons of the same father, who speak the same\\ntongue, Oh, must we be ever thus at enmity?',\n"," 'I have said this is a favorite place of resort, and here a party of gay\\nyoung people came to avoid the noise of the city, and spend a quiet day\\nwith their books and work, upon the fourth of July. Their little feast\\nwas spread under the shade of the fortress, and they were in the act of\\ndrinking to the day, when they were suddenly taken captive by a band of\\nEnglish soldiers. It was at that unhappy time when Canada was disturbed\\nby revolutionary projects, and it was naturally imagined they had come\\nthere purposely to insult them. It was an imprudent frolic, and they\\npaid dearly for it; they were marched off three miles to a military\\nstation, where, after being fully examined and no signs of revolution\\nbeing found upon them, they were suffered to depart and return as they\\nbest might. I relate the anecdote to show how easily we may mistake each\\nother’s motives, and how soon ill-blood may be brewed between those who\\nare suspicious of each other, and ready to take offence.',\n"," 'While we were thus discoursing, the sky grew gradually dark, and a veil\\nof blackness was let down{75} over the lake, giving token of a thunder\\nshower. We were soon in the boat which tossed very much, but we had able\\nyoung seamen who landed us safely just as the sun, bursting forth,\\nsmiled at our idle fears. An evening of social pleasure ended our\\nagreeable day.',\n"," 'June 30th.—This morning we were again employed in rambling about the\\ncity. The situation of Buffalo is calculated to make it a great\\ncommercial mart. It is upon the high road to the west, and will command\\nmuch of the business of the lakes, while the great Erie canal connects\\nit with the Atlantic. This canal is indeed a ‘herculean achievement.’ It\\nis three hundred and sixty-three miles in length, forty feet wide, and\\nfour deep; contains six hundred and eighty-eight feet of locks; is\\ncrossed by several fine aqueducts; and all this was completed in eight\\nyears. There are other canals connected with it. This great artery,\\nbringing up the produce of Europe to the west, through this city, must\\nincrease its prosperity[8] and population.',\n"," 'At twelve o’clock this morning embarked in the steamboat Constellation\\nfor Chicago, through lakes Erie, St. Clair, Huron and Michigan, a\\ndistance of twelve hundred miles, for which we are to pay twenty\\ndollars, ten each. The wharves as we left them presented a busy scene.\\nWe counted forty steamboats and canal boats, beside several large\\nvessels. Among the latter was the Queen Charlotte, a stately ship of\\nwar{76} belonging to Canada, but degraded to the ignoble fate of a Buffalo\\ntrader. She had, it is true, lost some of her original brightness ere\\nthus fallen, for she had been twenty-three years under water, having\\nbeen sunk in a naval fight on Lake Erie, and lately raised. The wharves\\nwere loaded with produce and merchandize, while carts, boats, and men,\\nwere loading and being unloaded.',\n"," 'We left Buffalo with regret. Its majestic river and noble lake—its back\\nground of forests, gay streets, and social people, have left a vivid and\\npleasing picture upon our memories. A fine pier, or breakwater as they\\ncall it, of solid mason work extends 1100 feet, protecting the wharves\\nfrom the waves. A light house stands upon the end of the pier. When the\\ncity had completely faded into the distant horizon we turned our gaze on\\nour companions. Upon one corner of the deck was a promiscuous heap of\\nchairs, children, pots, kettles, men and women, being a family moving\\nwest. That old man with a cocked hat, and large metal buttons, the young\\nman in a blue frock, and women with embroidered stomachers and\\nindescribable caps, sitting upon a pile of strange looking articles of\\nhusbandry, and huge unwieldy chests, is a band of emigrants from central\\nEurope. A party of English gentleman from Canada were there, bound upon\\na hunting expedition to Wisconsin—another of Buffalo young men, were\\ngoing to while away the summer months in a fishing excursion upon Lake\\nSuperior, a long light skiff being part of their travelling luggage.\\nThere were also tourists for pleasure, information and health like\\nourselves, and some few going to inspect lands which they had bought\\nunseen. Our{77} steamboat is a very fine one although not of the first\\nclass. There is a handsome saloon for the ladies surrounded by a circle\\nof state-rooms opening upon the deck—below are the eating rooms and\\ngentlemen’s cabin, the whole fitted up with comfort and elegance. There\\nare about 53 steamboats upon lake Erie, some of them of six hundred\\ntons, and fitted up with every luxury and elegance, many costing from\\n$15,000 to $120,000 each. They are built upon a fine model, and are well\\nfinished. The upholsterer’s bill sometimes amounts to $4,000. They are\\ngenerally built very strong to resist the waves that run high here. The\\ncomplement of men for one of these boats amounts to 40; the captain\\nreceiving $100 a month. After an excellent dinner we ascended to the\\npromenade deck which, like our Hudson river boats is the uppermost deck,\\nsurrounded with seats. We were out upon lake Erie, and gazed around us\\nwith wonder and delight. The water was a fine dark green, which as the\\nwind was high, was tossed in waves crested with white foam, or sparkling\\nspray. The shores were in some places low and wooded, alternating with\\ngentle elevations, at whose foot ran a line of yellow sand—a sky of\\npurest azure dotted with fleecy clouds was above. What a lovely scene—',\n"," 'asks Sir Walter. This lake however is rather larger than his Scottish\\nlake, it being 290 miles long. It has the character of being the most\\ntempestuous of all the lakes, a fact we were soon able to verify, for in\\nthe afternoon the wind increased to a gale, and the{78} waves dashing\\nagainst our vessel gave us each time a shock as if she had struck a\\nrock.',\n"," 'The ladies soon began to feel the effects of such tossing, and one after\\nanother retired to their berths quite ill. Forty-five miles from Buffalo\\nwe stopped at the town of Dunkirk, which is the termination of the New\\nYork and Erie rail road. It commences at Hudson river 25 miles above the\\ncity of New York, a distance of 450 miles from its end. This town, under\\nthese circumstances, is rising rapidly. It has a fine circular bay\\nhaving two projecting points which protect it, one and a half miles\\nacross—and is one of the best harbors upon the lake. There is also a\\npier within the shelter of which five large schooners were moored. We\\nobserved a rail road depot ready for the future engines and train—a\\nchurch, tavern and a few stores. Several little boys came on board with\\npails of cherries for sale, which they disposed of at four cents a\\nquart. Here we landed a passenger, an inhabitant of Dunkirk, who, during\\nthe voyage, had been vaunting the advantages of his town. The day would\\nsoon come, he said, when he should no longer resort to Buffalo for his\\ngoods, as the new rail road would bring all the trade to Dunkirk.\\nDarkness drove us to our state room, which we found replete with every\\nconvenience—a circumstance much to our satisfaction as we were to spend\\na week in it ere we reached our destined haven. I would recommend you if\\nyou ever travel this way, to choose, as we did, a state cabin looking\\ntowards the shore, for these boats stop at every considerable town, and\\nof course keep near the coast. In consequence of this arrangement, we\\ncould, if inclined, sit in our cabin, and through the open door, or{79}\\nwindow, behold the scenery at our ease; while those upon the opposite\\nside, gazed out upon an uniform waste of waters without a shore. I thus\\nobtained a sight of the town of Erie where we stopped during the night.\\nAroused by the noise, I looked from my window and saw the town\\ndistinctly by clear starlight. This town is in Pennsylvania, and is the\\ntermination of the Pittsburg and Erie canal. In the canal basin, beside\\ncanal boats, I saw a large steamboat and several schooners. Presque Isle\\ndefends the harbor. There was a large hotel brightly illuminated, and\\nsome stage coaches, awaiting the arrival of passengers. Erie stands upon\\na high mass of Schistose rock surmounted by a stratum of clay—the whole\\nforty feet above the lake.[9] There is said to be here a neat court\\nhouse, and several pretty houses surrounded by trees—the streets are at\\nright angles, and the trade considerable. There was a bridge spanning\\nthe canal, which I hoped was the one where the revered La Fayette was\\nfeted. It was formed into a large tent by sails and flags, which had\\nwaved in the battle upon the lake, under which was a fine collation.\\nSeveral ships of war have been built here. You will surely give me\\ncredit of being a first rate correspondent when I leave my slumbers to\\ncollect items for your amusement and edification.',\n"," 'July 1st.—Early this morning we found ourselves off Conneaut, which\\nwe looked upon with interest as belonging to the great state of Ohio. It\\nis a small place, at the mouth of Conneaut creek near the boundary line\\nbetween Pennsylvania and Ohio—is a small{80} but flourishing place. The\\nnext town we passed was Ashtabula, or rather its landing place, the town\\nbeing some miles in the interior. A wooden breakwater defends the\\nharbor. A river of the same harmonious Indian designation empties itself\\ninto the lake sullying its pure acqua-marine, with a dark brown tint\\nwhich could be distinctly seen a mile from the shore. The day is\\nlovely—our boat glides swiftly upon her course. On one hand we have a\\nline of green waving forest coast, where the oak, the elm, the linden,\\nand the maple, and stately yellow birch are standing in pretty groups,\\nor gracefully bending over the water—upon the other we have a shoreless\\nocean. For miles there are no signs of human existence, and then some\\nlittle village appears with its invariable accompaniment, a pier,\\nlighthouse and schooner. We passed Fairport, at the mouth of Grand\\nriver, and from thence the ground begins to rise, being a band of\\nargillaceous schist, which extends to Cleveland. This is a beautiful\\ntown standing upon this formation mixed with sand and pebbles elevated\\nsixty or seventy feet above the lake of which it commands a fine\\nprospect. It was a pretty object in our view as we approached, its\\nsteeples and buildings crowning the summit of the picturesque cliff. We\\nlay here some hours taking merchandise, thus enjoying sufficient time to\\nexamine it. The steamboat passed up, the Cuyahoga river through two\\npiers each 1200 feet in length. Upon each side the ground arose from the\\nriver covered with the buildings of two rival towns, Cleveland and Ohio\\ncity. The business streets are upon the banks of the Cuyahoga river, and\\nthe wharves were lined with vessels, merchandise and native buckeyes, as\\nthe Ohio{81} people are called after their beautiful tree. Cleveland is\\nbuilt upon a plain; the streets running at right-angles, wide and airy\\nwith a pretty square in the centre. There are six churches, a neat court\\nhouse, banks, public library, and many handsome dwelling houses. The\\npopulation is 7,000 and several newspapers and periodicals are published\\nhere.[10] It is 170 miles from Buffalo. We had been a day and a half\\nreaching it, on account of our frequent stoppages. This being the\\nnorthern termination of the Ohio canal a great deal of business is done\\nhere. Their trade in flour and wheat is very great, they having exported\\nnearly a million of barrels of flour in one season—cotton, tobacco and\\nother southern merchandise has passed up from the Ohio river through the\\ncanal. This canal runs the whole length of the state of Ohio to\\nPortsmouth upon the Ohio river a distance of 309 miles. It is forty feet\\nwide, four deep, and has 152 locks.[11] The Cuyahoga river is sixty\\nthree miles in length, and running down over the sandstone ledges which\\nabound in that region, it has a fall of 240 feet, affording a fine water\\npower. From Buffalo to the borders of Michigan there is a band of\\nalluvion upon the lake shore from three to twenty miles in width. This\\nis bounded by a ridge of rocks 40 or 50 feet high once, according to\\nDarby and Schoolcraft, the original boundary of the lake, thus giving\\nanother proof that these lakes were once higher than at present they\\nare. This ridge is composed of micaceous limestone, and{82} schistose\\nrocks, covered with farms, and groves of beech and oak which attain to a\\nlarge size. Yesterday afternoon while sailing upon the lake, we observed\\nthese hills making a pretty back ground to the towns on the shore—now\\nit trends too much to the interior to be seen. In this ridge arise\\nwaters which flow each way, some into lake Erie, and others, as the\\nMuskingum and Alleghany, into the valley of the Ohio. This last river,\\nbecoming the Ohio, falls into the gulf of Mexico ‘upwards of twelve\\ndegrees of latitude from its source.’[12] Successive ledges or steppes\\nof sandstone rock lead down to the lake, over which the rivers flow in\\nrapids or falls, making the scenery in that region very beautiful. We\\ntook in at Cleveland several barrels of flour, and nails, and Selma\\nsalt, and boxes of merchandise,—landed several passengers, and then\\nleft this interesting town. It must, I imagine be a very delightful\\nplace of residence. The Cuyahoga could be distinctly traced some\\ndistance from the shore in a long dark line.',\n"," 'The swell in the lake still continuing, most of our passengers had\\nbecome too ill to leave their berths. A horse which was at the other end\\nof the vessel also became affected. Our German emigrants felt it least,\\nas they had been seasoned by crossing the Atlantic. I saw them seated\\nupon their packages, eating brown bread and cheese as merrily as ever.\\nTheir passage costs them little as they provide their own frugal fare,\\nand sleep upon their goods on the deck. Several others pursued this\\neconomical plan. The emigrants from the German and Swiss nations are\\ninvaluable to us and ought to be warmly received, for in industry,{83}\\neconomy and patience, they set a very excellent example to our\\nextravagant people. They always succeed; their settlements and farms\\npresent an admirable order and neatness, and yield a rich reward to\\ntheir patient labor. The restless spirit, the excitement, caused by a\\nhope of rising in the world, of seeing no one above him, which animates\\nthe American bosom, and many of our transplanted brethren, never\\nagitates them. Where they plant themselves they remain, and in labor and\\nsocial duties, pass the even tenor of their way. The motion, rendered it\\nimpossible to walk, or even stand unless supported, and instead of being\\nunpleasant to me, I have seldom experienced sensations so novel and\\ndelightful. My companion being an old traveller felt no ill effects from\\nit either. Leaning over the railing, we watched the vessel as she\\nsurmounted one huge wave to sink again as soon. The fresh western\\nbreeze, breathing perfume from the forest clad shores, exhilerated our\\nspirits, and spread forth our star-spangled banner in a bright canopy\\nover our heads. Two noble steamboats filled with passengers from the\\n‘far west’ passed us with their banners flying, the bells of the three\\nboats ringing out their friendly salutations to each other. They are\\ngone—the white foam of their track alone remaining to show where so\\nmany human beings had just been wafted away. How glorious was that\\nsunset on lake Erie! Dark and stormy clouds had gradually gathered from\\nevery quarter, and now dropped down as a veil over the west concealing\\nthe sun from our view, and the lake is one vast gloomy abyss. But\\nsee—some fairy hand has touched the clouds with gold and purple and\\nevery gorgeous hue—the surface of the{84} water is streaked with rose, and\\nevery wave is gilded. The towers of Cleveland now distinctly painted\\nagainst the dark horizon, are glittering as if cut from jewelry. Our\\nfears of storms are vanishing, when suddenly a black terrific cloud\\nspotted with fiery blood color, appeared in front of us, as if the\\nIndian Manitou had arisen from the lake to arrest our progress and\\nforbid our farther entrance into his dominions. Larger and larger it\\ngrew, until the heavens were covered with inky blackness, A terrible\\nblast lashed the lake into fury—the waves arose in their might as if to\\nreject us from its bosom—our vessel careened fearfully upon one side,\\nand confusion ensued. Men hurried forward to remove the merchandise to\\nthe other side and trim the vessel—women’s heads were, from the cabin\\ndoors asking ‘what’s the matter’ and torrents of rain are surging over\\nthe deck. The awnings are buttoned down—all is proclaimed tight and\\nright, and we retired to our state-room to listen to the wail of the\\nwind, and write our promised journals.{85}',\n"," '\\nJuly 2, 1840.\\n',\n"," 'Dear E.—Rocked by the tempest we slept soundly, but arose in time to\\nwitness a glorious sunrise scene upon lake Erie. We were in the centre\\nof the lake—no land was visible on either side, save two lonely\\nislands, one of which was just vanishing upon the distant horizon, while\\nthe other one was only a short distance from our vessel. Suddenly a\\ndazzling radiance shot up from the east, and in a few moments the sun\\ncame rushing from out the water as if in eager haste to greet his\\nfavorite lake. A flood of glory lighted up the green depths of Erie;\\ntinging the foam with a thousand prismatic hues, and tipping with gold\\nthe white plumage of the birds which were soaring over our heads. The\\ndark alleys of beech, maple, and hickory which covered the island, and\\nits pebbly shore covered with diamond spray, were illumined with the\\nmorning rays, receiving new beauty from every touch. We were stretching\\nfrom Sandusky bay upon the Ohio shore to the Detroit river; many islands\\nwere{86} passed, some of them quite large. Cuningham island contains 2,000\\nacres. They are of limestone rock covered with forest trees. Here was\\nthe scene of the famous naval battle upon lake Erie, and these peaceful\\nglades once echoed with the cannon’s roar. I regretted not seeing\\nSandusky, a large and pretty town, situated upon a river and bay of the\\nsame name. Here also is the mouth of the Maumee river, or the Miami of\\nthe lakes, northern termination of the great canal which commences at\\nCincinnati, and is connected with the canals of Indiana.',\n"," 'Land began to appear upon our western quarter, and soon the State of\\nMichigan became visible. The mouth of Detroit river was soon after seen\\nhere, five miles wide from the Canadian shore to Michigan. At\\nAmherstburg, a small Canadian town, we stopped about seven o’clock, for\\nthe purpose of taking in wood. The flashing of bayonets and the red\\nuniform, as the sentinel walked up and down the wharf, told us we were\\nin a land belonging to another nation. Fort Malden is passed soon after.\\nUpon a platform, in front of the fortress, a file of soldiers were going\\nthrough their exercises, their brilliant scarlet dresses and arms,\\nprettily flashing back the morning sun. A boat, filled with red-coated\\nsoldiers, was passing over to an island to relieve the guard which stood\\nupon a romantic point, near his little sentry box. A large ship came\\nrapidly down the river, with all its sails out, looking like a huge bird\\nof prey winging his flight to the shore, adding to the variety of the\\nscene. Detroit is a beautiful river, connecting lakes St. Clair and\\nErie. Its width is generally about a mile—opposite Detroit city\\nthree-fourths of a mile. The shores are very beauti{87}ful, cultivated upon\\neach side, with several pretty islands in the centre. Upon the Canadian\\nside we observed several French settlements, their windmills upon every\\npoint giving a novel and unique effect to the scene. We did not reach\\nDetroit until ten o’clock, although it is only 19 miles from the mouth\\nof the river, owing to our delay in taking in wood. The city appeared\\nwell, covering a plateau of ground elevated 40 feet above the river.\\nThree steamboats were in sight as we approached, one being a ferry boat\\nto the town of Sandwich, opposite. As we were to remain here some time\\nwe landed and walked about the city. The city stands upon a plain which\\ncommands an extensive view of the river and surrounding country. A broad\\nstreet runs through the centre called Jefferson avenue, lined on each\\nside with shops and hotels. At the upper end are several handsome\\ndwellings surrounded with gardens. The churches are common in their\\nappearance, except the catholic, which I must say was uncommon. It is a\\nlarge building of unpainted wood, having two odd looking steeples\\nexactly alike, in the centre of the front; at the back is a dome having\\non each side a belfrey. Adjoining this is the residence of the Bishop, a\\nlarge brick building. I was disappointed in the appearance of this city.\\nIt was built by the French, you know, in 1670, and being so much older\\nthan Rochester or Buffalo, we naturally supposed it would be larger than\\nit is. But the same causes do not operate here which influence the\\nprosperity of the other cities. It has not the old and settled state of\\nNew York behind it, nor the great canal. Michigan, of which Detroit is\\nthe capital, has been recently settled, and that only in the southern\\nparts. The fur trade was for years its{88} main dependence, and that has of\\nlate fallen off very much. As man invades the recesses of the forest,\\nthe animals retreat before him. Detroit has, however, felt the wind in\\nher sails, and is rapidly following after her southern sisters. Of this,\\nthe increase of population is one proof—2,222 being their number in\\n1830, and 1839, 9,278. Several railroads are planned out, which, when\\nthe river and lakes are filled with ice, will be of much service. Of\\nthese, the Detroit and St. Joseph are the principal—leading from this\\ncity across the State to lake Michigan, a distance of 194 miles; 33\\nmiles are completed. Many persons take this route to Chicago, in\\npreference to the more extensive one around the lakes. Besides these,\\nthere are in contemplation the Detroit and Pontiac; Shelby and Detroit,\\n&c. Michigan will soon fill up, as its population has increased since\\n1830, seven hundred per cent.; then it was 28,600, and now, in 1840,\\nthey count 211,205. Detroit will then be the great depot of the lakes,\\nand bids fair to rival the neighboring cities. Here we landed our German\\nemigrants, who were bound to the rich plains of Michigan. Upon the wharf\\nwere men busily engaged packing white fish salted, with barrels, fifty\\nof which we took on board. The white fish is a delicious fish, something\\nthe form of our shad, averaging from 4 to 10 lbs. and sometimes weigh 14\\nlbs. There is a great trade of this fish upon the lakes. 30,000 barrels\\nwere exported from Cleveland this season. While passing the city, when\\nwe had resumed our voyage, we observed several rows of handsome ware\\nhouses, many of which seemed as if newly erected. We also noticed a\\nlarge brick building erected for the hydraulic works which supply the{89}\\ncity with water, it being in these lakes fit for cooking, washing and\\ndrinking. This city is the scene of one of Pontiac exploits. He was one\\nof those brave and haughty spirits who cannot accustom themselves to the\\nyoke of the white men. Of these, a few have appeared in latter years;\\nBlack Hawk being the last. The French he had become accustomed to, and\\nsuffered their presence in his realms, but when another nation appeared\\nhe determined to root them out the land. They were at peace apparently,\\nbut a deceitful peace, for Pontiac was organizing a confederacy against\\nthe English, who then occupied Detroit. ‘There was no sounding of the\\ntocsin, no alarm of war given, no motion of the waves were felt,’ to\\nquote the words of McKenney—‘In this moment of stillness, a scout\\nreturned bringing the intelligence that a large body of Indians were\\ncrossing lake St. Clair in canoes, and coming in the direction of\\nDetroit, while numerous bands were appearing at every point.’ Pontiac\\nappeared in the neighborhood with 3,000 warriors, who, in a friendly\\nmanner approached the fort, erected their wigwams, and commenced their\\nIndian games, to lull all suspicion. That very band, unknown to the\\nEnglish, had just returned from the bloody massacre of Fort\\nMichilimackinack, which they had surprised in the manner they now\\nintended. Major Gladwin, however, suspected them, and admitted only six\\nIndians at a time in the fort. The wily Pontiac at length succeeded in\\nhaving a council held at the fort, and was permitted to attend with\\nthirty-six chiefs. Their rifles were cut short and hid under their\\nrobes, with which they were to shoot down the officers and seize the\\nfort. Were it not for the fidelity of a squaw to{90} her master in the\\nfort, the plan would have succeeded. As it was, they suffered severely\\nfrom famine, and many were cut off who came to reinforce them, before\\nthe Indians finally retreated. Ten miles from Detroit the river\\ngradually expands into lake St. Clair. A pretty lake—a most sweet\\nlake—appearing small among its larger sisters, and yet it is 90 miles\\nin circumference. The waters are cool and transparent, fringed with the\\ngraceful ash, the linden, ‘tasseled gentle,’ the beech, and the stately\\nlioriodendron, and many other varieties. We felt reluctant to enter and\\nruffle the glassy surface, and disturb the profound repose which reigned\\naround. The shores are low and there are no houses in sight. A wood\\ncutter’s hut, and at its extremity, a light-house, were the only signs\\nof life we saw. The trees were throwing their flickering shadows upon\\nthe placid water, or leaning over, as if to admire their own reflection\\nso perfectly painted upon the mirrored surface,—',\n"," 'If you do not choose to emigrate to any of those charming spots I have\\nmentioned along the road; if Auburn, or Rochester, or Cleveland do not\\nlure you, perhaps you would like to come to the picturesque shores of\\nSt. Clair, and weave you a bower ‘in some sweet solitary nook’ under\\nthose trees of ‘ancient beauty;’ or erect a picturesque hermitage with a\\npet skull, and moralize and spiritualize your hours away. I have heard\\nmany declare they could better worship their Creator in the fields and\\nwoods than in temples made{91} with hands, and can ‘look from nature up to\\nnature’s God.’ I fear such are greatly deceived in the nature of their\\nfeelings, and many a lonely anchorite has thus mistaken adoration of the\\nbeauties of creation for worship of its Creator. His heart may be filled\\nwith the most elevated emotions while contemplating the glory and\\ngrandeur of God’s works, and he may be subdued to tears of tenderness\\nwhile reflecting upon that kindness and mercy which has adorned the\\nresidence of man with such exquisite loveliness; but will that\\nregenerate his heart? will it give him a knowledge of his Savior; shew\\nhim the mysteries of faith and redemption, and subject his will to that\\nof Christ? If so, let him live upon a mountain top, and gaze at will;\\nbut I much fear these sentiments are but the ‘semblance of sacredness.’',\n"," 'The shores of St. Clair, being low, display the rise which has taken\\nplace in these northern lakes. That there is a rise and fall in this\\nsingular mass of fresh water has been observed for many years; and many\\nopinions have been hazarded as to its cause. Some of the Indians declare\\nthere is a regular rise and fall every seven years; while the scientific\\ntraveller, Darby, tells us there is a rise once in fifty years. A\\nperson, upon whose knowledge we could rely, told us at Buffalo, one\\nyear, while he resided upon the banks of the St. Lawrence, the current\\nran out of lake Ontario at the rate of ten miles, and the next year the\\nlake had unaccountably risen, and ran thirteen miles an hour. It must\\nhave been one of those extraordinary floods, of course much higher,\\nwhich caused the lakes to overflow, as I have mentioned above—that is,\\nif it were not a diluvial torrent. The captain of our steam{92}boat, who\\nhad navigated these lakes for several years, a man of intelligence and\\nintegrity, agreed with the Indians in the belief of a gradual rise and\\nfall in seven years. During these last two years the water has risen to\\nthe height of five or six feet. Our captain pointed to many spots, upon\\nthe shore, where the water had overflowed the land. Upon one pretty\\nplace a farm house had been abandoned, and a fine apple orchard,\\nstanding two years in the water, had been destroyed; and now, while all\\naround was green, their limbs were bare and leafless. A very intelligent\\nman, a settler upon the river St. Clair, pointed to several noble maple\\nand beech trees, as we passed the Michigan shore, whose gradual decay he\\nhad watched, while making his spring and fall trips in order to purchase\\ngoods in New York. It was pitiable, he said, to behold such goodly\\ntrees, ‘green robed senators of ancient woods,’ sinking beneath the\\nsubtle destroyer, as some noble heart withering away at the touch of\\naffliction! He watched them with an interest he would a friend consuming\\nunder a slow decay—their glorious beauty dimmed and faded, until a\\nlifeless skeleton alone remained.',\n"," 'This man’s history interested us much, and I will relate it for your\\nedification. He was a native of our city of New York, one of a large\\nfamily straightened for means. While quite young he had married, and\\nstruggled for years to support his family respectably, but sickness and\\n‘bad times’ rendered his lot a gloomy one. Hearing so often of the\\nhappiness and pros{93}perity of ‘the west,’ he resolved to remove thither,\\nand accordingly bought a tract of land upon St. Clair river, then\\nfarther west than it now is. He came here twenty years since, with a\\nwife and several young children, and a mere trifle in money. A little\\nvillage has now risen around him, of which he is the owner. He has built\\na good tavern for travellers, which he rents out; has erected a\\nsaw-mill; a few shops and houses, and a little church. His children are\\nmarried and settled around him; and he is, as he expressed himself,\\n‘independent of the world.’ Once a year he goes to New York or Buffalo,\\nto purchase goods for his shop. How much better is this state of things\\nthan to remain, struggling for a morsel, among the hungry crowd of a\\nlarge city. I asked him if he never repented renouncing a city life.\\n‘No, indeed!’ he answered—‘I go there once or twice a year to transact\\nbusiness, but hurry away, for I feel as if in prison. I want elbow room,\\nand never breathe free until threading my green lakes and vast forests\\nagain. I am glad to leave such fictitious existence, where each man\\nmodels his conduct upon that of his neighbor, and dare not act as his\\nspirit prompts him.’ We had passed into St. Clair river, and about\\nsun-down dropped this man and his goods at his little village, which was\\nseated upon a green slope, cut out of the forest, upon the Michigan\\nshore. The houses were surrounded by little gardens and seemed\\ncomfortable.',\n"," 'The sign of the village inn was swinging in the summer breeze; a\\ntraveller had just alighted from his horse in front of the piazza, and\\nthe steam from his mill was rising high above the trees tinted purple in\\nthe evening light. From a shop door a young man,{94} probably his son,\\naccompanied by a neighbor, stepped forth to greet him; while, from the\\nhoneysuckle-covered porch of a neat cottage a woman, whom I fancied his\\nwife, was looking eagerly out to watch his approach. Every thing denoted\\nindustry, cheerfulness, and independence.',\n"," 'Soon after leaving the village of Clay, we observed a ship at anchor\\nnear the shore, quite a picturesque object. It proved to be the\\nMilwaukie, a ship of three hundred tons burthen, bound from Buffalo to\\nChicago. It was waiting for wind, or steam, to enable it to enter lake\\nHuron, as this lake pours into the river St. Clair with so strong a\\ncurrent, that vessels can seldom stem it without a strong wind. She was\\nsoon attached to our steamboat, and we both passed swiftly along. What a\\nsuperb western sky! The sun has long left us, and yet we scarcely miss\\nits light, so golden and so brilliant is the mantle he has left behind\\nhim. It is nearly nine o’clock, and yet I can see to write this, but\\nfatigue drives me to my cabin, and forces me to say adieu until\\nto-morrow.',\n"," 'July 3d.—Still in the river St. Clair. We stopped some hours in the\\nnight at Newport, to take in a supply of wood. The captain purchased\\neighty cords at $1,50 a cord. He told us it was his opinion the\\nsteamboats upon these waters would soon be obliged to burn coal,\\nalthough surrounded by such a world of trees, as there is so much time\\nwasted in stopping for it. I did not regret our detention, as I was\\nanxious to lose no part of a scenery to me so novel and pleasing. This\\nis a beautiful river about sixty miles long, and half a mile broad,\\nhaving several little towns upon it.{95} Cotrelville and Palmer we had also\\npassed in the night; the latter a thriving place, from which a rail road\\nis contemplated to Romeo, twenty-six miles, there to meet the Shelby and\\nDetroit rail road. A communication will thus be continued with Detroit\\nthrough the winter. The country upon the Canadian shore is wild and\\nuninhabited, while the Michigan side of the river is frequently adorned\\nwith fields of grass or wheat, or thrifty orchards. The houses are\\nplain, but seemed surrounded by every comfort. Our course ran quite near\\nthis shore, so close, that I might fancy myself transported into the\\nmidst of a farm yard, with all its morning business going on. A pretty\\nwhite wood house is before me now, surrounded by fields and barns,\\nhaving a row of cherry trees in front whose fruit is glistening red in\\nthe morning sun. In the barn yard a man is chopping wood, to cook the\\nbreakfast, I suppose—another is busy hoeing in a potatoe field—a boy\\nis leading a horse down to the river for water, while numerous other\\nchildren are arrested in their play and stand open mouthed gazing at\\nus—ducks are dabbling in the wavelets—pigs are rooting up the turf—a\\nflock of geese are running down the bank at us with beaks and wings\\nextended in a warlike attitude—while a sober cow chews her cud under a\\nlarge hickory nut tree. The next moment all is gone, to give place to\\nthe silent groves of oak, maple and ash. Upon a long narrow island near\\nthe Canadian shore, my eyes were attracted by what seemed a row of\\nhaystacks. I enquired the meaning, and was told I was looking upon an\\nIndian village, and these were wigwams. I was delighted to behold a\\nveritable Indian lodge, and to see real Indians, instead of those\\nhalf{96} civilized beings I had met at Niagara. They are a body of\\nChippeway Indians who reside upon Warpole Island under the care of a\\nMissionary of the Methodist church. Their wigwams consisted of poles\\nmeeting at top, around which, coarse matting, formed of reeds is\\nfastened. From the apex of these cones smoke was rising, telling of\\nculinary operations going on within. Around each lodge was a small patch\\nof potatoes or corn. A small church, with the missionary cottage and a\\nfew log cabins, were in the midst. Groups of Indians were lounging upon\\nthe bank gazing at us, while others unconcernedly pursued their usual\\noccupations of fishing or hoeing. How much more graceful were those wild\\nsons of the forest, than the civilized men I had observed upon the\\nshores I had passed. Their mantles of cloth or blanket stuff, trimmed\\nwith gay colors, were gracefully thrown around them, and their\\nornamented leggins or moccasins glittered as they walked. How dignified\\nis the tread of an Indian! we remarked as we passed the island, many in\\nvarious occupations and attitudes, yet they never moved awkwardly, nor\\nsprang, nor jumped in a clumsy manner. The missionary cottage was an\\nobject of great interest to us. I had often read of these self-denying\\ndisciples of Jesus, but never before looked upon the scene of their\\nlabors. Here in this lonely shore, away from all they love—their\\nfriends and home—and almost shut out from the face of civilized man,\\nthey spend their days in laboring to ameliorate the lot of these unhappy\\nchildren of the forest. In bringing them to the feet of their master,\\nthey are indeed conferring a blessing upon them past all return. As a\\nrecompense for the bright land their{97} fathers have taken from the\\nbereaved Indian, they are leading them to another, brighter and more\\nlasting. There is no change, nor shadow of turning—there, no enemy can\\ndestroy their homes—there, the tears are wiped from their eyes, and all\\ntheir sorrows soothed. Noble missionary, who can appreciate thy\\nsacrifice? None but those who have come from a civilized land, where\\nthou hast passed thy early days, and who now sees thee among the endless\\nforests with no associates save those wretched savages, can understand\\nthe greatness of thy disinterestedness. During the short summer, a\\nresidence may be tolerable, but when the rivers and lakes are choaked up\\nby ice, the short glimpse he has obtained of his fellow man, while\\nwhirled past in a steamboat, will be denied him. The roar of the winter\\nwind will shake his cottage, and the wolf will scare him from his\\nslumbers. But what are earthly joys or sorrows to a child of Christ? His\\nmeat and drink is to do the will of him that sent him, and in return for\\nthe comforts and pleasures of civilized life, he receives a peace ‘the\\nworld cannot give’—a joy, David in all the glory of his kingly life\\nsighed for, when he prayed ‘Give me the joy of thy salvation.’ A small\\nsettlement is formed at the mouth of Black river, called Port Huron,\\nwhich is to be the termination of another canal across the state.',\n"," 'Here we found another vessel waiting for wind. It was the brig Rocky\\nMountain, bound to Green Bay, being attached to our other side we passed\\n‘doubly armed.’ Near the point where the river leaves lake Huron stands\\nfort Gratiot, an United States military station whose white walls and\\nbuildings, over which the{98} American flag was waving, looked out brightly\\nfrom among the dark forest of the Michigan shore. A line of blue coats\\nwere going through their morning drill; and a few cannons looked out\\nfiercely upon us. A small white Gothic church, and a cottage stood near;\\nthe whole making a pretty cabinet picture. The river now narrowed to a\\nquarter of a mile, upon each side a point—the American side crowned by\\na light-house, and the Canadian by a cluster of Indian cabins. A bark\\ncanoe, paddled by five Indians, pushed off the shore and came after us\\nwith the greatest rapidity, their long black hair flying wildly behind\\nthem. Our two vessels retarded our motion a little, so that the Indians\\novertook us, and kept at our side for some distance. They used their\\npaddles with astonishing quickness, and we were surprised to see them in\\ntheir ‘light canoe,’ keep pace with our large steamboat. It was however\\nfor a short distance only—they were soon fatigued with such great\\nexertion, and turned towards the point, and sprang out, or rather\\nstepped out with the greatest dignity, drew the canoe to the shore, and\\nthen squatted down upon the bank evidently enjoying their race. I use\\nthe above inelegant word, as being very expressive of their posture. The\\nIndian never sits down as we do—with his feet close beside each other,\\nand his body erect, he sinks slowly down—his blanket is then thrown\\nover his head and around his feet, so that nothing is seen except his\\ndark glaring eyes. Through the narrow pass before mentioned, between the\\ntwo points, the waters of Huron run with a swift current. Here we were\\nfurnished with another evidence of the rise of these waters.',\n"," 'An officer of the army and his wife were our fellow{99} voyagers, very\\nintelligent and agreeable persons. They had been stationed at fort\\nGratiot a few years since, and had frequently roved over the beach\\naround the light-house in search of the pretty silecious pebbles, agate,\\ncamelian, and calcedony, which are often found upon these shores. To\\ntheir surprise, they now found their favorite point, ‘curtailed of its\\nfair proportions’ by a rise of nearly five feet of water. Our steamboat\\nand its two ‘tenders,’ passed between the points out of St. Clair river,\\nand we found ourselves at once in a large and shoreless lake, with\\nnothing in front, between us and the bright blue sky, which touched the\\ngreen waters in the far horizon beyond. The transition is so sudden from\\nthe narrow opening, to the boundless lake as to produce a grand and\\nexciting effect. Once out upon the calm waters of Huron, our two guests\\nwere loosened from their tackles, and spreading their huge wings, they\\npassed one to each shore, and we soon left them far behind. About an\\nhour after, the bell of our steamboat startled the still lake with its\\nclamors, denoting the approach of some vessel. We looked out in time to\\nsee the noble steamboat Great Western rush past us as if upon the wings\\nof a whirlwind. She was on her way from Chicago to Buffalo. Her bell\\nanswered ours, and the deck was crowded with passengers. One of these\\nstanding alone by himself, and taking his hat off attracted our notice\\nand we discovered in him an old acquaintance from New York. These\\nmeetings in a distant land are very interesting, carrying our feelings\\nat once to the home we had left. This steamboat is one of the largest\\nupon the lakes, is finished in a style of great{100} elegance, and is said\\nto be as long as the English steamship of the same name.',\n"," 'This whole day since ten o’clock—we have been passing through Huron\\nunder a cloudless sky. The lake is two hundred and fifty-five miles\\nlong, and its waters are of a deeper tint than those we have passed,\\nowing to its great depth, as we are sailing over nine hundred feet of\\nwater, while in some places it is said to be unfathomable. The color is\\na dark olive almost black, and it is only when the sun shines through\\nthe waves that we can perceive they are green. The cause of the various\\ncolors of water has produced many a hypothesis. Sir Humphry Davy tells\\nus the primitive color of water is like the sky, a delicate azure.[13]\\nHe says ‘the finest water is that which falls from the atmosphere—this\\nwe can rarely obtain in its pure state, as all artificial contact gives\\nmore or less of contamination; but, in snow melted by the sunbeams\\nthat has fallen upon glaciers, themselves formed from frozen snow, may\\nbe regarded as in its state of greatest purity. Congelation expels both\\nsalt and air from water whether existing below, or formed in the\\natmosphere; and in the high and uninhabited region of glaciers, there\\ncan scarcely be any substances to contaminate. Removed from animal and\\nvegetable life, they are even above the mineral kingdom.’ Water from\\nmelted snow, then considered as the purest, Sir Humphrey goes on to\\ndescribe its color. ‘When a mass is seen through, it is a bright blue,\\nand according to its greater or less depth of substance, it has more or\\nless of this color.’ ‘In general when examining lakes and masses of\\nwater in high mountains, their{101} color is the same bright azure. Capt.\\nParry states that water in the Polar ice has the like beautiful tint.’\\nThe brown, green, and other colors of rivers he imputes to substances\\nover which they flow, as peat bogs, vegetable and mineral substances. He\\nallows the sea cannot be colored from any thing upon the bottom, but\\nimputes the tint to the infusion of iodine, and brome which he has\\ndetected in sea water, the result of decayed marine vegetables. Of this\\nprimitive water are our lakes formed, originating as they do in regions\\nof snow and ice. Lake Superior, from whence they flow, is a vast basin\\nof trap rock, of volcanic origin.[14] It is the most magnificent body of\\nwater in the world, five hundred miles long, and nine hundred deep, and\\nperfectly pellucid. Into this pure, and originally, azure primitive\\nwater, there flow forty rivers, upon the south side alone, according to\\nMr. McKenney of the Indian department, who counted this number from St.\\nMary’s to the river St. Louis. These rivers he tells us are all amber\\ncolored. Why then may not these yellow rivers flowing into blue water,\\nproduce green. You see I like to hazard a hypothesis as well as\\nothers. I hope you will not call this absurd. Col. McKenney himself,\\nimputes the green color to reflection of the ‘rays of light passing\\nthrough the foliage of the shores, conveying their own green hue unto\\nthe surface of the water from which they are reflected.’ This might be\\nthe case in small rivers or lakes, but it cannot thus tint such a vast\\nextent of water. A writer in the American Journal of Science, is of\\nopinion the color of water is reflected from the sky, and is blue, dull,\\nblack, or{102} golden, as the sky may be—and that ‘green is produced in\\nwater, by the yellow light of the sun mixed with the cerulean blue\\nthrough which it shines.’ On the contrary the Count Xavier de\\nMaistre,[15] does not impute the color of water to any infused\\nsubstance, nor to reflection from above, but reflection from the surface\\nbelow, ‘as the blue color of the sky is owing to reflection from the\\nearth beneath.’ ‘Limpid waters, when they have sufficient depth,’ says\\nthe Count, reflect like air, a blue color from below,—and this arises\\nfrom a mixture of air, which water always contains to a greater or\\nlesser amount. This blue color, being the primitive hue of water is\\nsometimes clouded or lost by earthy infusion, or reflections from a\\ncolored sky. The green tinge which he sometimes observed in water, he\\ntells us, is occasioned by reflection from a white surface below. This\\nhe proves by his experiment of a sheet of tin painted white let down\\nbeneath the water—and his description of the water in the beautiful\\nlimestone grotto, on the shore of the Mediteranian at Capri. The green\\ntint observed in the ocean is only seen when it is so shallow, as to\\nreflect the sun’s rays from the earth beneath it.',\n"," 'As the States surrounding these lakes are more or less underlaid by\\nlimestone, we may suppose the bottoms of the waters are in some places\\npaved with it; and from this, or the shores under the water and around\\nit, may be reflected, according to the Count’s theory, the light which\\ngives the water a green appearance. But I will not trouble you with any\\nmore speculations; they come with an ill grace from me who{103} only pretend\\nto describe all that passes before my eyes.',\n"," 'In the afternoon we were off Saginaw bay, an indentation in the coast of\\nMichigan running seventy or eighty miles deep and forty wide, making the\\nlake here very broad; in one spot we were out of sight of the land. A\\nriver of the same name flows into the bay, upon which, about\\ntwenty-three miles from its mouth, is a small town. A canal is proposed\\nfrom this bay, across the state to lake Michigan, at Grand or Washtenog\\nriver. How shall I convey to you an idea of the loveliness which sat\\nupon earth, air, and water this afternoon! Certainly that sunset upon\\nlake Huron is the most beautiful I have ever beheld. The vast and\\nfathomless lake, bounded by the heavens alone, presented an immense\\ncircle, ‘calm as a molten looking-glass,’—to quote from my favorite\\nJob—surrounded by a band of fleecy clouds, making a frame work of\\nchased silver. Slowly and gracefully sank the orb, the white clouds\\ngently dispersing at his approach, and leaving their monarch a free and\\nglorious path. As he drew near that chrystal floor, all brilliancy faded\\nfrom the face of the lake, save one bright pathway from the sun to\\nus—like the bridge of Giamschid leading from earth to heaven. The sun\\nwhich I had always been accustomed to see above, was now below me, near\\nthe water, on the water, under the water! A veil of purple is thrown\\nover it, and now the sun sleeps on lake Huron. The gold and rose which\\npainted the western sky have gone. Darkness has stolen over the world\\nbelow, and we turn our eyes above. What a high and noble dome of\\nloveliest blue! Upon one side there hangs a cres{104}cent of the purest\\npearly white, while at its side steals forth one silver star, soon\\nfollowed, as, saith Ezekiel, by ‘all the bright lights of heaven,’ until\\nnight’s star-embroidered drapery is canopied around us. What bosom is\\ninsensible to this gorgeous firmament? Who hath not felt the ‘sweet\\ninfluence of the Pleiades’ while gazing at this starry roof above? I\\nwish I could make you a piece of poetry upon this subject, but as there\\nis enough already composed upon the stars, I will send you a bit of\\nByron and tell you—',\n"," 'Do you remember that little hymn our old nurse used to teach us in our\\nchildhood:',\n"," 'Yes, from childhood to manhood, we wish to penetrate into the mysteries\\nof those golden regions, and ever ask them to tell us ‘what you are.’ We\\nsee them gem the night with their lustrous beauty; we watch them as they\\npace their azure courts, and lose ourselves in high imaginings, too vast\\nfor us, while earth still keeps our souls its prisoner. How much deeper\\nmust be the interest with which the astrologer of old followed them in\\ntheir ‘golden tracks.’ In them he read his destiny, and thought to see\\nthe scenes of earth reflected in their light. How must he have gazed\\nupon them, as their rays paled or brightened, while reading in them ‘the\\nfate of man and{105} empires.’ Man’s efforts to penetrate the mysteries of\\nthese glorious creations have not been all in vain. The Almighty\\narchitect, from time to time, graciously bestows upon him, knowledge of\\n‘parts of his ways.’ How much more has been vouchsafed to us than to the\\nearly nations. Looking back through the vista of the past, we shall see\\ngreat men appear, as ‘stars to rule the night’ of our darkness and tell\\nus of creation’s mysteries. Solomon, Ptolemy, Gallileo, Copernicus,\\nTycho Brahe, Paschal, Newton, Herschel, with a host of satellites, have\\nbeen graciously shown the book of knowledge, to light man’s pathway\\nthrough the earth, and enlarge his ideas of the magnificence and the\\nbenevolence of his Creator. ‘In the beginning,’ it did not enter into\\nGod’s purpose to tell mankind more of the starry host, than that they\\nwere ‘lights to rule the night,’ and for ‘signs and for seasons;’ now\\nsee what amazing things have been shown to us. We know they are worlds\\nlike our own, filled with mountains and seas; having night and day,\\nsummer and winter. We see their fields, now white with snow, now dark\\nwith returning vegetation. How our hearts bound with hopes of future\\nknowledge; and imagine the time will come, when we can gaze upon their\\nlandscapes, and ‘listen to the hum of their mighty population.’[16] We\\nhave seen nature in all its power and grandeur, while tossed on Erie’s\\nwaves, or listening to the thunder of Niagara; but here she is at rest\\nin all her quiet loveliness; and would her worshippers behold her in her\\nfairest mood, let them come and gaze at evening on lake Huron.{106}',\n"," 'July 4th.—The sun and I arose at the same time. When I left my\\nstate-room, as if waiting to greet me, it arose majestically from the\\nbosom of the water, flooding the lake with light. No land was descried\\nupon the east, but we were near the Michigan shore off Thunder bay. The\\nShanewaging islands which stretch across it were distinctly visible, and\\npresented various beauties of shape and tint. All trace of man has now\\ndisappeared, for the northern part of Michigan has never been settled\\nowing to the intense cold of the winters. We have passed a long line of\\ncoast without any inhabitant (except a forlorn woodman’s hut in one\\nspot) stretching for two hundred and fifty miles, covered with boundless\\nforests, in whose green recesses there are paths ‘which no fowl knoweth,\\nand which the vultures eye hath not seen.’ Here is the home of the bear,\\nthe elk, and the moose-deer—and upon the aspen, oak, and maple trees,\\nsport the blue bird, the robin, and yellow hammer, undisturbed by the\\nfoot of man. We have now past the bounds of civilization, and our vessel\\nis the only spot of life in this vast region of forest and water.',\n"," 'From the entrance of Lake Huron to Mackinac, there were but two places\\nwhere man was visible. At the mouth of the Zappa river soon after\\nentering the lake, there is a cabin where a woodman resides in the\\nsummer season to supply the steamboats; and at Presque Isle where we\\nstopped in the afternoon there is another cluster of cabins, and\\nwoodpiles. Our Captain did not stop at this latter place, as he did not\\nlike their wood, it being chiefly swamp ash. The shore is low, covered\\nwith trees, having below, a beach of yellow sand, until just before\\ncoming in sight of{107} Michilimackinac when the land becomes a little\\nelevated. Ten miles this side of the last mentioned place, we passed\\nBoisblanc, a large wooded island, taking its name of ‘white wood’ from\\nthe silver barked birch tree. This island belongs to government, and its\\nonly inhabitants, save a few straggling Ottowas are the family of the\\nlight-house keeper whose pretty tenement, and stately light-house,\\nappear upon a projecting point. There is also a farm upon the island\\ngiven by government to the Missionaries of Michilimackinac, who\\nsometimes maintain a farmer upon it. O Mackinaw, thou lonely island, how\\nshall I describe thy various beauties! certainly for situation, history,\\nand native loveliness, it is the most interesting island in our States.\\nWe approach it through an avenue of islands, Drummond and Manitoulin,\\ndimly seen on our east, and Boisblanc, and Round, in our western side.\\nStretching across our path, far away in front of us, is Mackinaw,\\npainted against the clear blue sky. The island of Michilimackinac, or\\nMackinaw, or Mackinac as it is commonly spelt and pronounced, is a high\\nand bold bluff of limestone about three hundred feet above the water,\\ncovered with verdure. Its name signifies in the Indian tongue great\\nturtle, as it is something of the figure of this animal. At the foot of\\nthe bluff are strewed the buildings of the town. Among the most\\nconspicuous of these are, the agency house and gardens, residence of Mr.\\nSchoolcraft, Indian Agent—and the church and mission house. Along the\\nbeach were several Indian wigwams, while numerous pretty bark canoes\\nwere going and coming, as this is the Indian stopping place. A very\\nbeautiful, and conspicuous object was the United States fort, presenting\\nat a distance{108} the appearance of a long white line of buildings\\ninserted, into the top of the island high above the town. As we\\napproached, its picturesque block-houses and the pretty balconied\\nresidences of the officers, came out to view, having the banner of the\\n‘stripes and stars’ waving over them. While gazing at this fair picture,\\nsuddenly a brilliant flame, and volumes of white smoke arose above the\\nfort, while a booming sound told us they were firing their mid-day\\nsalute in honor of the day. This added much to the beauty and grandeur\\nof the scene. As our boat was to remain there for some hours, we\\ndisembarked and ascended to the fort to visit our friends the commanding\\nofficer and his family. We found them sitting upon their balcony,\\nlooking down upon the newly arrived steamboat. After the first greetings\\nand mutual enquiries were over, we were shown all it was thought would\\ninterest us.',\n"," 'The view from our friend’s balcony was beautiful in the extreme. The bay\\nin front, the lovely islands around covered with a luxurious\\nvegetation—the town spread out at our feet—the Indian lodges, and the\\ncanoes skimming the bright waters, each called forth our expressions of\\nadmiration. Passing into the interior of the fort, and through the fine\\nparade ground and a large gateway, we found ourselves upon the summit of\\nthe island. Our path lay through copses of white birch, maple, and\\nvarious other trees, and over green sward covered with strawberries and\\na variety of wild flowers. Our friends kindly gathered for me a variety\\nof these, among which was a fine scarlet lilium superbum, blue bells,\\nand kinni kanic, or Indian tobacco, and a pretty plant called Indian\\nstrawberry. Suddenly{109} the silver tones of woman’s voice, sounded near,\\nand in a fairy dell we came upon a tent, surrounded by a party of ladies\\nand gentlemen, busily engaged preparing for a fete in honor of the day.\\nAmong them was the daughter of our host, and some of the celebrated\\nfamily of S——t. We were presented to the party, and were quite\\nchagrined our limited time would not permit us to accept their\\ninvitation to remain and partake of their festivities. The grace and\\nbeauty of Mrs. S——t made great impression upon us. To me she was\\npeculiarly interesting from the fact of her being descended from the\\nnative lords of the forest; for you know I have always taken the\\ngreatest interest in the fate of our Indian tribes. From the accent, the\\ndeep brunette of her smooth skin, and her dark hair and eyes, I should\\nhave taken her for a Spanish lady. From the tent we wound our way up to\\na high peak of the island. When near the summit, we left a grove, and\\nsaw before us one of the most picturesque and singular objects\\nimaginable. It was a high arched rock of white limestone, stretching\\nacross a chasm before us, making a pretty natural bridge, through which\\nwe gazed far down into the waves of Huron, at least two hundred feet\\nbelow. The surprise, the beauty and novelty of this striking object,\\nbrought forth expressions of admiration from us. The white arch was\\nadorned with tufts of wild flowers, and shrubbery. Ascending the arch,\\nwe gazed down upon the white beach below, whose pebbles could be here\\ndistinctly seen under the limpid water although many feet deep—and out\\nupon the fair waters, and the pretty islands, which',\n"," 'We were obliged to be satisfied with a hasty view of this charming\\nscene, as our time was limited; and we turned reluctantly towards our\\nboat, without visiting the ruins of fort Holmes, upon the high summit of\\nthe island. While passing through the town we observed several antique\\nhouses which had been erected by the French, who first settled this\\nplace in sixteen hundred and seventy three.',\n"," 'These are frail delapidated buildings, covered with roofs of bark. Upon\\nthe beach a party of Indians had just landed, and we stood while they\\ntook down their blanket sail, and hauled their birch bark canoe about\\ntwenty feet long, upon the shore. These are the Menominies or wild rice\\neaters, the ugliest Indians I had ever seen—also Winebagoes, with dark\\nskin, low foreheads and shaggy hair, and having no pretentions to dress.\\nI saw a chief however afterwards who was gaily bedizened with tinsel,\\nbeads, and paint, having one side of his face a light pea green, and the\\nother cheek scarlet. We watched them erect their lodges which was done\\nvery soon—a few poles were placed in a circle, one end of each stood in\\nthe earth, while the others met at the top—coarse matting was folded\\naround these, leaving an opening for a door, over which a blanket was\\nhung. Some matting being spread upon the floor inside, the children and\\nmoveables were placed inside, and the canoe drawn up near it. We visited\\nsome of the shops and laid up a store of Indian articles, which are made\\nby these poor people and sold here. Among them were small baskets called\\nMococks, made of birch bark embroidered with porcupine quills, stained\\ndifferent colors—this was filled with maple sugar. It is pleasant to\\nmeet friends{111} so far from home, but I think the pleasure is almost\\ncounterbalanced by the pain of parting. This we felt keenly, when the\\nplanks had withdrawn, and our friends had been forced to leave us, as we\\ngazed after them winding their way up to the fort, the shores, and\\nwaters around seemed more desolate, more lonely than before.',\n"," 'Just before the steamboat started we had an opportunity of judging of\\nthe boasted transparency of this water, its depth having prevented this\\non our voyage. I looked down into it from the boat, where it was twenty\\nfeet deep, and could scarcely believe there was anything but air between\\nus and those shining pebbles below. We had also an opportunity of\\nhearing some Indian music. Upon the shore sat a group of unearthly\\nbeings, one of whom struck several taps upon a sort of drum, accompanied\\nby the others, in what sounded like a wolf recitative—at the end of\\nthis all united in a yell which dyed away over the lake, much in the\\nstyle of a howling blast accompanied by the shrieks of a drowning\\ntraveller. Our fishing party left us here to go up the Sault St. Mary,\\ninto lake Superior, spending their summer days among the picturesque\\nscenery of that magnificent lake. We bade adieu with much regret to this\\npretty island, whose green terraces, fort and picturesque town, Indian\\nlodges, and light canoes, made a beautiful scene—but the most\\ninteresting point in the view, was that white handkerchief waving\\nfarewell from the fortress balcony.',\n"," 'This island is 615 miles from Buffalo; 319 from Detroit. There are water\\nmarks upon the rocks 200 feet above the lake, proving the water had\\nonce{112} stood so high. The scenery here has been prettily described by an\\nauthor of talent, Mrs. Jameson; but, as much pleased as I was with her\\nbook, I must regret she came here under such circumstances. It is with\\nreluctance I censure one so gifted, but it is with a view of warning\\nyou, and my young friends to whom I know you will show my letters,\\nagainst errors to which the very witchery of her genius would blind you.\\nHowever passionate a desire you may entertain for the picturesque, I\\nhope you may never leave the protection of your friends and wander in\\nsearch of it alone. May your curiosity to see great men never lead you\\nto invade the retreat of a world hating bachelor; and may you never\\nstray in wild forests, through storms and tempests, with no companion\\nsave a rude Indian, or a ‘bronzed, brawney, unshaven, back-woodsman,’\\n‘very much like a bear upon his hind legs,’ and you ‘a poor, lonely,\\nshivering woman.’ I quote her words. You had better be a ‘tarry at home\\ntraveller,’ or write ‘voyages around my own room.’ If you do thus, you\\nmust expect the ladies where you visit will look ‘formal and alarmed,’\\nas she tells us the ladies of Toronto looked upon her. But now I have\\ndone scolding and will pursue my journey. Upon a green slope of the\\nMichigan shore, a pile of ruins were pointed out as the site of old fort\\nMackinac, which was taken by Pontiac with a stratagem and afterwards\\nevery one within were massacred. How must those unfortunates have felt,\\nupon this desolate shore, hundreds of miles away from their country, and\\nat the mercy of savages. A band of Chippewa’s or Ojibwa’s were just\\npassing in canoes thirty feet in length. This tribe stands higher in\\nrank than the others,{113} and their language, like the French, is the\\npolite tongue among the Indian tribes. They have a ruler whose office\\nhas been hereditary for ages. He is called Mudjikiwis, and they pride\\nthemselves much upon his and their own rank and lineage. There is an\\nanecdote, related by Schoolcraft, of one of this tribe, which, if you\\nhave never seen, will amuse you. Chi Waishki, alias the Buffalo, was\\npresented by the commissioners of the treaty of Fond du Lac, with a\\nmedal as a badge of distinction. ‘What need have I of this?’ he said\\nhaughtily. ‘It is known whence I am descended!’ These canoes are the\\nprettiest and lightest things imaginable. They are formed of the bark of\\nthe birch tree, sewn together with a thread made from fine roots of\\ncedar split. The bark is soaked to make it more pliable. Sometimes they\\nare very gaily painted and ornamented. The paddles are of light wood.\\nOur Captain placed before us at dinner a very fine lake trout, which he\\nhad purchased at Mackinaw. It was two feet long, and very delicious.\\nFine salmon are also taken in these lakes. We were now upon the great\\nlake Michigan, which stretches from here three hundred and twenty miles,\\nto the Illinois shore, and is nine hundred feet deep. Our course lay\\nnear the Michigan shore, which presented high bluffs and points of\\nlimestone, with banks of pebbles, and high jagged hills, or dunes of\\nsand. These pebbles and sand are said to be thrown up by the\\nnorth-western winds, but I should rather imagine them left up by the\\nfloods which have swept over the land. Upon our right were Fox and\\nBeaver isles, beyond which, Green bay runs into Wisconsin, one hundred\\nand three miles. This northern shore of Michi{114}gan is uninhabited, and\\ncovered with dense forests. The ledges and masses of white limestone\\nupon some of these islands looked like fortresses or other buildings.',\n"," 'July 5th.—Sunday upon the lake. When I left my cabin, I found the\\nmorning was misty, and the sun looking like the yolk of an egg, was\\nbobbing up and down upon the water. It had just peeped above the waves,\\nwhich, dashing about, sometimes obscured it from our view. We were lying\\nat one of the Manitou islands, taking in wood. This is a pretty crescent\\nshape islet, covered with trees. In the centre we were told is a lake\\nwhich is unfathomable, and supposed to be connected with lake Michigan.\\nIt is filled with the large trout, salmon and white fish of the lakes.\\nThere is a woodman’s hut, and several large piles of wood upon the\\nshore. ‘Oh that the woodman would spare those trees.’ Soon the pretty\\nisland will be denuded and forlorn. It is a sacred island—the Indians\\nimagining it to be the residence of their Manitou, never dare to land\\nthere, as they believe such an intrusion would be followed by the anger\\nof their Deity. One Indian, who despised such superstition ventured upon\\nthe shore, and was never heard of since. The forests and lake in the\\ninterior, they imagine is the abode of the blessed after death, whose\\nhours will there pass in hunting and fishing. The Manitoulin islands in\\nlake Huron, are also sacred; but they are much larger than these, one of\\nthem being fifty-five miles in length. I secured a handful of pebbles\\nfrom the shore, which, like those of other lakes, are agate, chalcedony\\nand other sileceous minerals. Upon the{115} shores of lake Superior these\\nare found very fine, mixed with trachte, lava, and other volcanic rocks,\\nand with masses of native copper. I had brought with me a package of\\nwell selected tracks, which I opened this morning, and laid a few upon\\nthe table of the ladies saloon. Soon after, a pretty little girl knocked\\nat my state-room door, saying her mother wished to know if I had any\\nmore tracts, as she should like to read one. I asked her where were\\nthose I laid upon the table? those, she replied, some ladies were\\nreading. I gave her several. The chambermaid next appeared begging for\\nsome; and then the cabin boy came with the same request. While I was\\nselecting one which I thought might suit him, I observed a brawny dusky\\nfigure, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and his person begrimed with\\nsoot and smoke, gazing earnestly towards us. ‘That’s Tom, one of the\\nfire-men,’ said the cabin boy with a snigger; ‘he heard you had books to\\nlend and wants one dreadfully.’ I beckoned to him, and he came forward\\nwith alacrity, while behind him I discerned several other ‘grim visaged’\\nbeings peeping out from their compartment towards us. I gave him a\\npackage to distribute among his fellows; and during the day had the\\npleasure of observing the greater part of the crew and passengers busily\\nengaged with my books. During our long voyage, those who had books had\\nread them out, and those who had none, were getting very weary, so that\\nthey eagerly received any thing in the shape of reading. But some of\\nthem, I trust, read them for the sake of the benefit they hoped to\\nreceive from their contents. It was a source of great satisfaction to\\nbehold so many persons engaged in themes of high im{116}port to their soul’s\\nbest interest. These seeds were sown with a prayer for their success;\\nand who can tell what immortal plants may spring up in some of their\\nhearts, growing to a tree of life, and bearing fruit to flourish in the\\ngarden of paradise. Let me urge you never to travel without these, or\\nother useful books to distribute on your way—like the girl in the fairy\\ntale of our youth, shedding gems and treasures in your path. There is no\\nlibrary in this boat as upon our Hudson and Eastern steamboats, and we\\nwere often amused with the alacrity with which our books were snatched\\nup when we laid them down for a strole, or to look at some object upon\\nthe shores. When we returned we were always sure to receive them again,\\nand felt no vexation, as we knew they meant no impoliteness, and would\\nbe willing to lend us their own in return. My companion had never been\\nused to such socialisms in his country, and was quite amused at this\\nfree and easy sort of thing. Our books were some of them French, and\\nupon one occasion we found them in the hands of a simple hearted son of\\nthe forest, to whom books were so rare a treasure he could not resist\\nexamining them. He returned it with a smile, and said, shaking his head,\\n‘how you can make any sense out of that I can’t see, for I cannot read a\\nword of it.’',\n"," 'We lost sight of the Michigan shore at ten o’clock, and stretched across\\nthe lake towards the Wisconsin coast, which we first saw at four o’clock\\nP. M., thus being nearly all day out of the sight of land. This may give\\nyou an idea of the vastness of these lakes. Wisconsin, or Ouisconsin, or\\nWiskonsan, here presents a high bank, called ‘red banks,’ from the\\ncolor{117} of the soil, covered with forests, and showing no trace of man,\\nexcept at the mouth of the river Sheboygan, two hundred and twenty miles\\nfrom Mackinaw, where is a small settlement called by the name of the\\nriver.',\n"," 'Fifty miles from Sheboygan we stopped at the town of Milwaukie, towards\\nwhich the tide of emigration has been rapidly flowing. As the bay is\\ncrossed by a bar, our large boat could not enter, and a small steamboat\\ntook from us much of our merchandise and most of our emigrants. We did\\nnot go on shore, but contented ourselves with seeing the town from the\\nboat. It looked neat, with some comfortable dwellings, several shops,\\nhotel, court house, &c. It stands upon the Milwaukie river. Its\\npopulation is 1,000. Several rail-roads and canals are in contemplation\\nfrom this place across the territory, as rail-roads to Winnebago lake;\\nfrom Belmont to Dubuque; from Belmont to Dodgeville in the mine\\ndistrict; a canal from Milwaukie to the Black river, and another through\\nthe Fox and Wisconsin to the Mississippi. Wisconsin will be soon covered\\nwith a dense population, as it is now a favorite point for emigration.\\nThe soil is very rich, from one to ten feet deep, the surface undulating\\nprairie and woodland, consisting of 100,000 square miles of fertile\\nland. The grassy plains make fine pasture lands, and the lakes and\\nrivers produce abundance of fish, and give great manufacturing power.\\nLakes Superior and Michigan, and the river Mississippi surround three\\nsides, thus enabling them to send their produce to market. Flour, rye,\\ncorn, barley, white-fish, and many other articles have been exported\\nthis year. Their lead mines are very rich, and their valuable forests of\\npine trees will be another source of{118} wealth. These growing to the\\nheight of one hundred and eighty or two hundred feet, crown the heights\\nof the northern region of the country, which is mountainous, containing\\nseveral waterfalls, one of which is two hundred and fifty feet in\\nheight. The scenery is very picturesque. Madison, the capital, is a\\npretty, thriving town, surrounded by four transparent lakes, upon the\\nshore of one of which it is situated; it sometimes goes by the poetical\\nappellation of ‘city of the four lakes.’ When the roads and canals are\\nformed, Wisconsin will soon become a thoroughfare to the Mississippi and\\nthe vast regions beyond; and those who have ‘the world before them,’\\ncannot make a better choice than this. Here we left our Buffalo hunters.\\nRacine is a town twenty-two miles below Milwaukie. The houses looked\\nnew, and were arranged in rows upon the high green bank. The court-house\\nwas quite showy, having a portico in front, with pillars reaching to the\\nroof, which was painted red, surmounted by a tin cupola. It stands at\\nthe mouth of Root river. We were now again in sight of Michigan, as the\\nlake grows narrower towards the end. We have passed completely around\\nthis state, it being in the shape of a triangle. It is destined to be a\\ngreat and flourishing State, surrounded as it is by the lakes, crossed\\nby rivers, canals, and railroads, and covered by a rich soil. It is two\\nhundred and eighty miles long by one hundred and eighty, and covers\\n40,000 square miles. It has only been admitted into the Union as a State\\nin 1837, and now possesses a population of 211,705. The country is\\nlevel, except a table land in the center from which the rivers flow into\\nlakes St. Clair, Huron, and Michigan. The remainder is covered with\\ngrassy{119} prairie land, with transparent lakes, and tracts of woodland.\\nHere grows the valuable maple from which they obtain their sugar; the\\nwhite birch, whose bark is used for making canoes, roofing houses, or\\neven when split fine, in writing letters by the early settlers; the oak,\\nthe beech, the hickory, sassafras, and various other valuable trees. Its\\nenergetic inhabitants are busily engaged laying out canals and\\nrail-roads to intersect it in every direction, as means of conveying\\ntheir produce to its market. One hundred and thirty-one miles of\\nrail-road has been contracted for, but only forty-four miles finished,\\nfrom Detroit to Ann Arbor. Over this 41,896 barrels of flour were\\nconveyed this year to Detroit. Three years since the inhabitants of this\\nstate sent to Ohio for their flour, and now they export 125,000 barrels\\nof flour this year. Education is not neglected; the legislature have\\nappropriated 1,200,000 acres of land as a school fund, which, as the\\nland is rapidly rising, will be of great value. The celebrated\\nSchoolcraft tells us, it was deemed so inaccessible from swamps, that in\\n1818, it was not thought fit for the soldiers bounty lands. This was,\\nhowever, soon discovered to be a mistake. He further informs us, the\\nsoil is an argillaceous soil, mellowed with sands and pebbles, underlaid\\nwith schistose and calcareous rocks, clothed with an open growth of oaks\\nand hickories, the ridges covered with walnut, ash, beech, and maple,\\nwhile the valleys are first rate corn land, diversified with limpid\\nlakes, grassy prairies and pebbly bottomed brooks.',\n"," 'July 6th.—When approaching Chicago, the ‘haven where we would be,’ I\\ndid not so much watch for the{120} appearance of that famed town, as look\\nback with regret at the beautiful lake I was leaving, for I was well\\nassured ‘I ne’er should look upon its like again.’ Two days and two\\nnights I had been sailing over it, never tired of gazing at its varied\\nshores, or beauteous waters. Those who have never beheld these masses of\\npellucid, brilliant, green waters, can never imagine the extraordinary\\nloveliness of the scene. They cover a surface of 150,000 square miles,\\nand contain nearly half the fresh water upon the surface of the globe.\\nThat the water is fresh, is of great importance to those who dwell upon\\ntheir shores, as it can be of more use for household purposes, and\\nmachinery. The valley in which the lakes repose, is said to have been\\nhewed out by the deluge, leaving the deep chasms in which the waters\\nlie; this is called the valley of the St. Lawrence, and very properly;\\nbut I must object to this immense chain of lakes, four and five hundred\\nmiles long, and nine hundred deep, being called the ‘river St.\\nLawrence,’ as some fashionable tourists have of late. The St. Lawrence\\nriver is an outlet, but is no more entitled to this designation, than is\\nNiagara or St. Clair river. These lakes all lie in a valley which\\ninterposes between the primitive and secondary formations. The northern\\nshores are granite rocks, sterile, and scarcely inhabited; while the\\nsouthern is rich alluvion, covering sandstone and limestone.',\n"," 'The bustle of arrival aroused me from these reflections, and we were\\nsoon seated in the parlor of the Lake Hotel, in the famous state of\\nIllinois, and town of Chicago. The rapid growth of this place you have\\nheard of: in 1833 it could only count three frame{121} dwellings and two\\nhundred and fifty inhabitants; and now enumerates six churches, one\\nhundred shops, several hotels, dwelling houses, and ware-houses, and\\nbetween six and seven thousand inhabitants. Chicago, or Tshicawgo, as\\nthe inhabitants and Indians call it, is divided by a river of the same\\nname into two parts, between which is a free ferry and a bridge. The\\nshops are upon one side, and the dwellings upon the other. These last\\nare in the style of country residences, enclosed with white palings,\\nsurrounded by piazzas and gardens; some of brick, but many of wood and\\nneatly painted. Every thing looks quite new, as indeed it might; for\\nwhere now the town stands, was, as late as 1833, a fort, before which\\nwas encamped seven thousand Indians. Fort Dearborn was erected for the\\npurpose of protecting the frontier. It was attacked in 1812 by the\\nIndian tribes, and their allies, and those who escaped massacre, sought\\nprotection in fort Wayne. Another fort was built in 1818, but is now\\ndeserted and let out for tenements. There are houses of worship here for\\nseveral denominations; among them the Presbyterian church is most\\nconspicuous. It is of brick and neatly finished. Part of the money\\nrequired for its erection, was acquired by the ladies in a Fair. The\\nLake House is a very good hotel, situated among the dwelling houses. It\\nis built of brick, painted white, which, with its green blinds, gives it\\na pleasant appearance; every thing within was comfortable and good of\\nits kind. According to our usual practice, we ascended to the cupola of\\nthe hotel, where is a lovely view of the cottages and gardens at our\\nfeet, the broad prairies beyond, and the bright waters of Michigan\\nbehind us. This town{122} is beautifully situated upon the borders of the\\nlake, through which it holds constant communication with Buffalo and the\\neast. The other route I mentioned, from Detroit continues over the\\nrail-road at that city, and by cross roads to St. Joseph’s upon the\\nlake, from which place steamboats are continually plying to Chicago. It\\nis a shorter road, and gives the traveller a view of the interior of\\nMichigan. The Illinois and Michigan canal commences here, which is to be\\ncarried to Peru on the Illinois river, a distance of one hundred miles,\\nthus opening a communication with the Mississippi and the Gulf of\\nMexico. It is six feet deep and sixty feet wide, and is nearly finished.\\nThe climate here is variable. In the summer the wind will one day blow\\nover the surface of the prairies, and the weather will become very hot;\\nbut the next day, perhaps, it will come from the lake and cool it again.\\nIn consequence of the vicinity of the lake there is not much snow, and\\nit is not very cold.',\n"," 'We spent here one day only, but were able to see every thing in and\\nabout the town, and in conversation with those friends residing here,\\nobtained every information. We intended making a longer stay, but\\nlearned that the regular line of stages left town that evening, which\\nobliged us to go on or to stay longer than our time would admit. Before\\nreaching here, it was our intention to go to Michigan City, which is in\\nIndiana, upon the shores of the lake, and from thence cross Indiana to\\nMadison, upon the Ohio, through a fine succession of rail and\\nMacadamized roads. Our friends here, however, seemed to think it so\\nmonstrous a thing to return without beholding the celebrated\\nMississippi, when within a few hundred miles{123} only, that we determined\\nto alter our course and go down the Illinois river.',\n"," 'At nine o’clock at night we entered a commodious stage drawn by four\\ngood horses, which was to take us to Peoria, upon the Illinois, one\\nhundred and fifty-seven miles distant, for which we were to pay\\ntwenty-two dollars, eleven each, bed and board included. Beside us were\\ntwo other passengers. Crossing the bridge, we took up the mail at the\\npost office, and then drove through a long range of cheerfully lighted\\nshops until we found ourselves out of town. Here the road crossed the\\nwet prairie, as it is called, which, in some seasons, when the lake is\\nhigh, is overflown. Through this wet land we went splash, splash, nearly\\nhalf the night. A rail-road is proposed here, which will render\\ntravelling more pleasant. Hour after hour passed away, my companions all\\ndozing while I sought sleep in vain. The vast plain over which we were\\nmoving, seen through the dusk of a cloudy night, seemed a fitting place\\nfor dark deeds—a fine Hounslow heath, or Indian lurking place. But\\nthere are no bandits here, and the Indians were all over the\\nMississippi, and I was bidding such idle fears avaunt, when suddenly a\\nlow plaintive wail sounded over the waste, startling my companions from\\ntheir slumbers. ‘What was that unearthly cry?’ I asked. ‘Only a prairie\\nwolf madam.’ ‘Dear me!’ exclaimed the other passenger, a youth. ‘I hope\\nthere are not many of them, for sometimes wolves attack horses.’ ‘Not in\\nthese prairies, sir,’ replied the other passenger, ‘they are rather shy,\\nand afraid of us.’ ‘I am glad, at least, to see a light,’ returned the\\nyouth, ‘there must be a house yonder.’ ‘Yes, a bower in the rushes,\\nnothing else,’ replied the{124} other man. ‘If you follow that light it will\\nlead you a pretty chase through the marshes; it is a jack-o’lantern.’\\nThe hour, seen by the light of the coach lamp, proved to be twelve, and\\neach settled in his corner for another doze. A sudden halt of the stage\\nawakened us. The coachman took down a lamp and began to search for\\nsomething on the ground. ‘Halo, driver, what have you lost?’ asked the\\nyouth. ‘Only my road sir,’ he replied. ‘Lost your road!’ exclaimed the\\nyouth in dismay; ‘Lost in these lonely moors among wolverines and\\njack-o’lanterns! Here’s a pretty fix!’ ‘Driver you ought to keep the\\nskin off your eyes in such a dark night, I guess,’ said the other\\npassenger. I only wondered he could ever keep his road, as there was no\\nhouse or tree to mark his course even in the day, and one might easily\\npass over the worn pathway in these grassy plains. The driver soon\\nresumed his seat, having discovered his path; and gave us the agreeable\\nintelligence, he had gone three miles out of his way. A few hours after\\nthis, a huge body suddenly appeared before the window—it turned out to\\nbe a tree, a sign we were approaching a river. Soon after we found\\nourselves before the door of a small house, upon the banks of a narrow\\nbut deep and placid stream fringed with trees. This was the Des Plaines,\\na river which rises so near lake Michigan, that in times of its\\noverflow, boats have passed from one to another. This interlocking of\\nwaters which flow different ways, Darby considers ‘an astonishing\\nhydrographical anomaly.’ All the waters we had passed, have fallen into\\nthe Atlantic, while those we were now following find their way into the\\ngulf of Mexico. The Des Plaines is called a branch of the{125} Illinois,\\nwhich joins with the Kankakee, and afterwards the Fox, and the united\\nstreams take the name of the Illinois. Many modern writers consider this\\nas the Illinois, and drop the name of Des Plaines, which I should judge\\na proper arrangement. We awakened the drowsy owner of the house,\\nprocured some refreshment, and with fresh horses resumed our journey.',\n"," 'July 7th.—I fell asleep, and when I was awakened at dawn this\\nmorning, by my companion, that I might not lose the scene, I started\\nwith surprise and delight. I was in the midst of a prairie! A world of\\ngrass and flowers stretched around me, rising and falling in gentle\\nundulations, as if an enchanter had struck the ocean swell, and it was\\nat rest forever. Acres of wild flowers of every hue glowed around me,\\nand the sun arising from the earth where it touched the horizon, was\\n‘kissing with golden face the meadows green.’ What a new and wonderous\\nworld of beauty! What a magnificent sight! Those glorious ranks of\\nflowers! Oh that you could have ‘one glance at their array!’ How shall I\\nconvey to you an idea of a prairie. I despair, for never yet hath pen\\nbrought the scene before my mind. Imagine yourself in the centre of an\\nimmense circle of velvet herbage, the sky for its boundary upon every\\nside; the whole clothed with a radiant efflorescence of every brilliant\\nhue. We rode thus through a perfect wilderness of sweets, sending forth\\nperfume, and animated with myriads of glittering birds and\\nbutterflies:—',\n"," 'It was, in fact, a vast garden, over whose perfumed paths, covered with\\nsoil as hard as gravel, our carriage rolled through the whole of that\\nsummer day. You will scarcely credit the profusion of flowers upon these\\nprairies. We passed whole acres of blossoms all bearing one hue, as\\npurple, perhaps, or masses of yellow or rose; and then again a carpet of\\nevery color intermixed, or narrow bands, as if a rainbow had fallen upon\\nthe verdant slopes. When the sun flooded this Mosaic floor with light,\\nand the summer breeze stirred among their leaves, the irredescent glow\\nwas beautiful and wonderous beyond any thing I had ever conceived. I\\nthink this must have been the place where Armida planted her garden, for\\nshe surely could not have chosen a fairer spot. Here are',\n"," 'The gentle undulating surface of these prairies, prevent sameness, and\\nadd variety to its lights and shades. Occasionally, when a swell is\\nrather higher than the rest, it gives you an extended view over the\\ncountry, and you may mark a dark green waving line of trees near the\\ndistant horizon, which are shading some gentle stream from the sun’s\\nabsorbing rays, and thus, ‘Betraying the secret of their silent course.’\\nOak openings also occur, green groves, arranged with the regularity of\\nart, making shady alleys, for the heated traveller. What a tender\\nbenevolent Father have we, to form for us so bright a world! How filled\\nwith glory and beauty must that mind have been, who conceived so much\\nloveliness! If for his erring children he has created so fair a dwelling\\nplace, how well{127} adorned with every goodly show, must be the celestial\\nhome reserved for his obedient people. Eye hath not seen it—ear hath\\nnot heard it—nor can it enter into our hearts to conceive it.',\n"," 'I observe in all fashionable tours, what is eaten and drank seems to be\\nmatter of immense importance, and perhaps you will be disappointed if I\\ndo not touch upon themes of such high import. We had been warned our\\nfare upon these ‘lonesome prairies’ would be poor, and of course we did\\nnot expect the tables of a New York hotel. The scarcity of stone, and of\\nwood—as there are no pine and cedar except in the northern parts of\\nWisconsin—forbids much elegance in the few houses scattered along the\\nroad, and the first post house at which we stopped for breakfast was a\\nrude log cabin. Our detention during the night had prevented our\\narriving at the usual breakfast hour, and it was supposed we had taken\\nour meal elsewhere, and of course we were obliged to wait. ‘Breakfast!\\nBreakfast!’ was the cry of driver and passengers, as we alighted. ‘Aye,\\naye!’ returned the landlord—‘I will scare you up as good a feed as you\\ncould find in Chicago.’ The room we entered was plainly furnished, but I\\nremarked a pile of books upon a bureau, among which were the life of\\nGen. Harrison—Rollins Ancient History—Vicar of Wakefield, and several\\nreligious works. I regretted I could only place a few tracts among them.\\nWhen I travel again in such lonely parts, I will endeavor to find a\\ncorner in my trunks for a few good books to leave among this reading\\npeo{128}ple. The mistress and her daughter were very busy scaring up our\\nbreakfast, of which, I should think the chickens were the most scared.\\nThey soon placed upon the table cloth, some fine smoking potatoes from\\ntheir garden—nice indian meal cakes, eggs, milk, cheese, cucumbers,\\nbutter, bread, and ‘chicken fixens.’ Every thing, being native produce,\\nwas very nice, but the coffee being a foreign article, was not as good\\nas I have seen before, I must confess. The landlady’s method of\\npreparing it was so novel, that I will write off the recipe for your\\nedification. I had retreated to the kitchen fire, as I slept rather\\ncold last night, it being misty, and there observed her process. She\\nplaced some coffee grains in an iron pot, which, being scared about a\\nlittle until somewhat brownish, were laid upon the kitchen table, and\\npounded with a rolling pin. Boiling water being poured upon it, the\\ncoffee was dished up. Every one drank it contentedly, and I, being\\nthirsty drank it also. The driver who sat next to me, having lived much\\nin Chicago and other refined places rather turned up his nose, saying it\\nwas not half as good as he got at the Lake House. My companion contented\\nhimself with milk. While waiting at the door for the stage, our hosts’,\\nson galloped up, dismounted and tied his horse to the fence. The animal\\nlooked as untamed as if just caught, his wild bright eyes flashed from\\nbeneath his shaggy uncut mane, and he pawed the ground, snorted and\\nstruggled, as if determined to break away and scour the free plains\\nagain. ‘Your horse loves not restraint,’ said I, ‘he wishes to be free.’\\n‘Aye, aye! the critter snuffs a wolf and wants to be after him.’ ‘A\\nwolf!’ ‘Yes—he is my wolf hunter, and dearly does he love{129} a chase\\nafter them. When he sees them, nothing can stop him from chasing\\nthem—but they give him a pretty tough run sometimes. I have seen him\\nfollow one for a mile ere he overtook him, and then, with one stroke of\\nhis foot, the wolf is dead.’ I am sure the horse understood his\\nmaster—his eye was fixed upon us while he spoke, and when he ended,\\ntost his mane with a triumphant expression and stamped fiercely upon the\\nground, as if his enemy were beneath his foot.',\n"," '‘All aboard!’ cries the driver, and we were again upon our course, our\\nhorses prancing gaily as if refreshed by their breakfast. A tree\\nappeared against the horizon, looking exactly like a sail in the\\ndistance—others followed it, and soon beautiful groups of forest trees\\nwere sprinkled over the prairie in front. This was a token of the\\nvicinity of water, and in a short time we found ourselves upon an\\nelevated bank from which we looked down upon a verdant valley through\\nthe centre of which, ran a silver stream. This was the valley of the Des\\nPlaines—having every appearance of being the bed of a broad and deep\\nriver. Many geologists, among them, Prof. Sheppard, thinks this and the\\nvalley of the Illinois, have been scooped out, by a vast torrent pouring\\nfrom lake Michigan. Upon the opposite shore of the river and in this\\nvale, at the foot of the ancient bank, stands the pretty town of Joliet,\\nimproperly spelt Juliet. The whole scene, was one of great beauty. We\\ndescended the bank, which is nearly one hundred feet high, and is\\ncomposed of yellow water-worn pebbles. Winding down the road, upon the\\nhigh bank opposite, was a long train of covered waggons, filled with a\\nhousehold upon its way to{130} ‘a new home’ upon the prairies. After fording\\nthe stream, now rendered shallow by the summer heats, passing over the\\ngreen sward we found ourselves before the door of the principal hotel in\\nthe town. Joliet takes its name from the old French traveller, father\\nJoliet, who came here as a missionary in 1673, and stands at the mouth\\nof a little stream of the same name. This is growing into a place of\\nsome importance, as the Michigan canal crosses the river here, and all\\ntravellers to the Illinois pass through it. It has a fine water power,\\nfor the descent of this river to the rapids at Ottowa, is great—the\\nlockage of the canal being 142 feet. The population is over 600. There\\nis here a court house, houses of worship, mills, taverns, and several\\nshops. We remained here only long enough to change horses. While\\nstanding upon the steps, the covered waggons arrived, from which, looked\\nforth men, women, children, dogs and cats, while pots, and kettles, and\\nchairs, were dangling below. A group of sturdy looking men stood around\\nthe door. After our American fashion of asking questions, I addressed\\none of them who stood near me, and asked from what country he had\\ntravelled. ‘From St. Thomas, in Canada ma’am,’ he replied. ‘We are sixty\\nfamilies,’ said another, ‘and have left there because we want more\\nfreedom. We would live where we can say what we choose, and do what we\\nchoose. There our tongues are fettered!’ I learnt they were going to\\nRock river, a very fashionable place of emigration now. This is a\\nbeautiful stream, running through the north west part of Illinois into\\nthe Mississippi. The land is prairie upon its borders, which will well\\nrepay the agriculturist’s labors, while{131} its rapids place a great amount\\nof manufacturing power at the disposal of the settlers. The lead region\\nis also in its vicinity. At the mouth of Rock river, in the Mississippi,\\nis a pretty island of limestone, three miles long, which is occupied by\\nfort Armstrong, garrisoned by United States troops. Dixonville on this\\nriver is a growing town. This I learned from my emigrants, and\\nafterwards saw confirmed in a Gazetteer. So you see what a nice plan it\\nis while travelling to extract information from all you meet. I am never\\nbashful at asking. I bade adieu to the emigrants, hoping they would have\\ntheir full of chat from which it seems they were debarred, and let the\\nprairies ‘prate of their whereabouts.’ We re-crossed the river where we\\nfound the newer part of Joliet built in a solid manner, of the yellow\\nlimestone which is quarried here. The sides of the canal, and viaduct\\nwere also formed of this pretty stone, which gives quite a gay look to\\nthe place. It is said by Professor Shephard to be magnesian limestone,\\nwhich occurs also at Chicago, abounding in orthrocera, turbo,\\nterebratula, caryophillia, &c., and extends he thinks through the lakes.\\nIt is taken out here in stratified layers; and at Chicago, where it has\\na slaty structure, it is used for flagging. A few miles from Joliet, we\\npassed an object, to me of the greatest interest—it was an Indian\\nmound. This was a perfect gem—as regular, as smooth, and as green as if\\ncut out of an emerald—being an oblong of fifty rods high, and seventy\\nor eighty long. Although centuries have passed since it was formed, it\\nis as perfect in shape, as if just moulded. A beautiful, solitary thing\\nit is, telling of nations and events now lost in the mists of time. We{132}\\nsaw afterwards, several others, bearing upon their summits ancient oaks,\\nplain indication of their great antiquity. Flowers again in untold\\nnumbers, were covering the prairies, and here are many of our garden\\nflowers growing wild, as blue bells, flox, bouncing bet, sweet william,\\nroses, cocoris, beliotrope, astre, &c., beside wild flowers as fringed\\ngentean, solidago, orchis, yellow golden rod, scarlet lilly, wild\\nindigo, superb pink moccasin flower, and scarlet lobelia. There were\\nmany I had never seen—among them was a species of teazle, having a tall\\nstem, purple head, surrounded by a fringe of long pink leaves—I called\\nit the Indian fairy, for as its dark head bobbed about, and its pink\\nmantle flowed around it, it looked like a tiny Indian. In fact, flowers',\n"," 'were smiling and blooming in every direction. What a nice place for some\\nhortuculturist to transport himself and cottage. Rural Howett would\\nenjoy the scene—and Miller who loves to ‘babble o’ green fields’ and\\nflowers, would find fitting subject here for his blossoming pen.',\n"," 'I welcome every flower I see with tender pleasure as if the gift of a\\nfriend—for I know they were planted among us to add to our enjoyment.\\nTheir culture has soothed many a mourning heart, and their blossoming is\\nas eagerly looked for in the spring, as if their own loved one was\\nreturning from the earth. There is nothing that can so soon transport us\\nto scenes and friends long gone, and awaken buried memories of former\\njoy as these brilliant creations. Earth would look dim without them—the\\nbride would{133} want a grace—the bier would seem more gloomy—while the\\nsculptor, the artist, and the embroiderer, would lose their prettiest\\nmodel of adornment.',\n"," 'A line of trees proclaimed a river near, and we soon dashed through the\\nAu Sable, the horses dancing with joy, as the clear cool waters curled\\nabout their feet. The sight of a house upon the opposite bank, seemed\\nquite a novelty, as we had not seen one since leaving Joliet, at nine\\no’clock, and it was now one. The house was of boards painted white, and\\na hanging sign proclaimed it one of entertainment. Here we dined and\\nchanged horses. The meats were very good, the pies and custards\\ntolerable, but the vegetables were the finest we had ever tasted. Peas,\\nbeans, potatoes all were very excellent. Every thing we saw was from the\\nlandlords farm, which extended over the prairie some distance from his\\nhouse. He and his men, came in from the corn fields when the conch,\\nsounded for dinner, and without their coats—their shirt sleeves rolled\\nup, they placed themselves beside us—one does not dress for dinner upon\\nthe prairies. While travelling in unsettled countries one must leave all\\none’s nicities at home. It took us some little time to shut our eyes\\nagainst soiled table covers, iron knives and forks, &c.,—but once\\nresolved to overlook it, we succeeded, and ceased to notice it. When we\\nconsider what a life these early settlers have led, we should only\\nwonder things are as decent as they are. The man comes out here in his\\nyouth, with an axe, upon his shoulder—hews him a space in the forest\\nand erects a log hut—here upon the floor, spread with the skin of a\\nbeast perhaps, he sleeps, his only companions, his dog, or an Indian—he\\ngradually acquires{134} furniture of his own making, and when he came to\\neating from a table instead of a stone or a stump, he thinks himself\\nvery comfortable. A table cloth is such a luxury that he scarcely\\nremarks when it gets soiled, as even then it is cleaner than his log\\ntable, and knives of the coarsest description are treasures to him. Our\\nlandlord spoke of his prairie land with the greatest enthusiasm. The\\nground is very hard to break, generally requiring several yoke of oxen,\\nwhile beneath that the mould is several feet in thickness without\\nstones, requiring no manuring and apparently inexhaustible. Some of the\\nold settlements, where farms had been worked for twelve years, it was\\nstill as fertile as ever—giving the tiller very little trouble, and\\nyielding rich crops. The oasis, or ‘oak openings,’ upon the prairies are\\nvery beautiful. We passed through one this morning. It presented the\\nappearance of a lawn, or park around some gentleman’s seat. The trees\\nare generally oak, arranged in pretty clumps or clusters upon the smooth\\ngrass—or in long avenues, as if planted thus by man. From their limbs\\nhang pretty vines, as the pea vine—lonicera flava, honey-suckle—and\\nwhite convolvulus. While our carriage wound among these clumps, or\\nthrough the avenues, it was almost impossible to dispel the illusion\\nthat we were not driving through the domain of some rich proprietor, and\\nwe almost expected to draw up before the door of some lordly mansion.\\nOur afternoon drive from the Au Sable to Ottowa was through a treeless\\nprairie, looking very much like a vast lake or ocean. So much is this\\nappearance acknowledged by the country people that they call the stage\\ncoach, a prairie schooner. When{135} the sun shines brightly over the\\nlandscape, its yellow light gives the prairie an azure hue, so that one\\ncan scarcely see where the earth ends, and the sky begins. The\\nundulations are a very singular feature in the landscape. This is best\\nseen at early morning or sunset light—the summit of every little swell\\nis illumined, while the hollow between lies in shadow, thus making the\\nground a curious chequer work. We saw many prairie hens, or species of\\ngrouse this afternoon, but no wolves or deer, much to my regret. The\\nroad is so much travelled that they avoid it and retire to more\\nsequestered places. Birds innumerable, were sporting in the sun’s light\\namong the flowers, and butterflies clad like Miltons angels, in ‘purple\\nbeams, and azure wings, that up they fly so drest.’',\n"," 'And now you ask, to what is the prairie land owing; fire or water? Many\\nare the theories upon this subject. The Indian name for prairie, is\\nscutay, (fire;) and they are in the custom of burning off the grass\\nevery fall. Some will tell you, to this must be traced the dearth of\\ntrees. As the mould is so deep—in some places twenty feet, and there\\nare in it, except in one or two places, no trace of trees or the huge\\nstumps they leave, this does not seem probable, at least the trees must\\nhave been burnt from ages. Others will tell you it is the sediment of an\\nocean which is spread over the land—or in some places large lakes. In\\nIllinois it is said there was once as large a lake as Michigan, which,\\nburst its barrier at the grand tower rocks upon the Mississippi. A chain\\nof lakes it is said have once stood upon the western land which have\\nleft these basins of deep alluvion covered with herbage. These water\\ntheorists, one of whom is Schoolcraft,{136} point to the bowlder’s of\\ngranite and gneiss which are scattered over the country from the\\nnorthern ocean to the gulf of Mexico, lost rocks, as they are called, as\\ntraces of this flood. Why not join the two theories? The land has no\\ndoubt been covered with water; this is proved by the ‘lost rocks,’ by\\nthe hard packed soil like the bottom of a lake; by its inky blackness,\\nwhen wet, as we see in marshes, and, by the marsh grasses, and water\\nplants which are seen growing upon it. This land, when dry was occupied\\nby the Indians, who kindled a fire at the edges of a circle, among the\\nrushes, which drove the animals in the centre where they were caught.\\nThe roots of the prairie grass is not destroyed by fire, and it\\ntherefore could not so completely eradicate the roots of those enormous\\ntrees which grow upon the western land. There is nothing in a prairie\\nland to prevent the growth of trees, as wherever the fire is checked\\nthey immediately spring up. The rivers also protect their trees from\\nfire.',\n"," 'Prairie land occupies two thirds of the State of Illinois; the dearth of\\nwater, and wood, and stone, will prevent them from being settled very\\nthickly, except in the vicinity of the rivers; so that these beautiful\\nplains will long remain undisturbed to gratify the traveller’s eye. The\\nprairies would of course be underlain with coal, as this great mass of\\nvegetation which has been destroyed by the floods which have stood upon\\nthem, pressed beneath the incumbent strata and exposed to heat,\\nmoisture, and pressure, will produce fermentation, and afterwards\\nhardened strata; accordingly it is found that coal is universal every\\nwhere in the west. Why should we stop at{137} second causes in considering\\nthe origin of prairies; why speak of Indian fires, or rushing floods?\\nThe Almighty mind who hath conceived this admirable globe, and who, with\\nsuch infinite taste, hath formed and beautified it, decking it with\\nflowers and every other delight, has spread out this fair western world\\nwith lakes immense, and stately forests, wondrous cataracts, smiling\\nprairies, and broad rolling rivers, to decorate the abode of His loved,\\nalthough erring sons. He, in his wisdom, foresaw the time would come,\\nwhen the exhausted soil, and crumbling institutions, and crowded homes\\nof the old world, would require a new field for its overgrown\\npopulation, and held this world perdu beneath the ocean caves until the\\nfitting moment. When the hour had come, it arose fresh and blossoming\\nfrom the sea, adorned with a goodly variety of mountain, lake, fair\\nplain, and noble river, to compensate the lonely wanderer for the home\\nhe has been forced to leave. Now is not that a pretty theory? That this\\ncontinent was much longer submerged beneath the diluvial flood, and is\\nindeed a new world, is, I believe, generally conceded by geologists.\\nThere is something delightful to look upon the earth, as we do here, in\\nits pristine glory and virgin freshness. The waters may have lingered\\nlonger upon the broad valley which lies between the Alleghany and Rocky\\nmountains, depositing that rich alluvion which lies so deep upon the\\nland, and when departing, ploughed its way through those great valleys\\nwhere now the western rivers flow. It was then, perhaps before the\\ndeluge, the abode of that monstrous saurian race, some sixty feet in\\nlength, whose bones are now dug up in Texas, and{138} must be under the\\nsoil. When their ‘days were fulfilled,’ they were destroyed and sank\\nbeneath the floods to harden in the limestone; and when the land had\\nbecome dry, the mastodon arose and stalked over the western plains; for\\nsince he has been discovered buried in the soil of Missouri, with Indian\\narrows sticking in his flesh, he is proved not to be antediluvial. When\\nhis career was over, the Indian tribes were admitted into the new born\\nworld; and whatever interest we may take in their fate—however we may\\npity them, we must all agree they have misused their gift. Their talent\\nwas hid, the fields were untilled, the stores of marbles and metals,\\nand materials choice and rare, which were placed there that man might\\nrear him a comfortable habitation, and lordly temples for his God,\\nremained unknown in their secret deposites. The Indian was doomed to\\nshare the fate of the mammoth: the barrier which concealed this world\\nfrom the older part was loosed, and the waves of human population that\\nrolled over it, has pushed back the Indians, step by step, and thinned\\ntheir ranks, and will thin them, until their race also lies under the\\nsoil whose riches they knew not how to use.',\n"," 'It is a singular and interesting thing to stand, as I do now, upon the\\nconfines of the earth, as it were, ‘at the green earth’s end,’ and gaze\\nback through the vista of time, over Europe, and Africa, and Asia, upon\\nthe nations that have risen and flourished, and become extinct, each in\\nits turn, like those animal races, whose story is sculptured, geologists\\ntell us, upon the ribs and arches of the earth beneath us. There we look\\nupon the decline and fall of nations—here upon their blossoming\\nspring-time. And it is a curious{139} thing to look on here and see the\\nmachinery of world making at work—to behold the progress of society\\ngoing on under your eyes, from its infancy to its maturity. As in a\\npanorama we behold the wigwam of the savage pass away to give place to a\\nlog hut; that disappears and a goodly farm appears; then a settlement, a\\nvillage, a town in succession, until at last, an imposing city filled\\nwith institutions for all arts and sciences; with temples, academies,\\nand all appliances of society in its state of culture and maturity.\\nWhile thus watching nations rising and setting; moved and transported\\nupon the earth’s surface as the pieces of a chess-board, a guiding hand\\nis as distinctly visible, as upon the walls of Beltshazzer’s palace. To\\nthe poor Indian the hand-writing again appears: ‘thou art weighed in the\\nbalance and found wanting!’ Beware ye, who have inherited his land, that\\nthe sentence be not written up against you also!',\n"," 'A ground swell, rather higher than the rest, placed us upon an\\nelevation, from whence we looked down upon the enchanting vale of\\nOttowa. A verdant plain lay below us, over which two bright rivers were\\nwinding, the Fox and the Des Plaines, which meeting, formed a broad and\\nnoble stream, which runs 220 miles from this spot to the Mississippi.\\nThe Illinois, first takes that name here. The plain was bounded in the\\ndistance by groves of stately trees, and by the bluffs of the Illinois.\\nIn the centre of this fair valley, just where the ‘bright waters meet,’\\nis the little town of Ottowa. It is youngling, just come out, and\\ncontains only 1,006 inhabitants, but is rapidly increasing. A gentle\\ndescent of about a mile, brought us to the banks of the Fox, beneath the\\nshadow of the shrub{140}bery which fringed its shores we drove some time\\nfollowing its windings and gazing at the bright sheen of its waters\\nglittering through the foliage. We forded it twice while crossing the\\nvalley, and so pure and transparent was the stream, that the pebbles\\nwhich lay upon the sandstone floor, could be seen as distinctly as in\\nthe hand. The canal passes here, and the workmen were building a\\nhandsome viaduct, across the stream. The Fox river is here about 100\\nyards wide, but is low at this season. It rises in Wisconsin, and is\\nnavigable to within fifteen miles of lake Michigan near Milwaukie. Many\\nparts of its shore are richly wooded. The rapids upon the stream afford\\na great amount of water power, serviceable for machinery. A short drive,\\nafter again crossing the Fox, brought us before the door of the\\nprincipal hotel, called the Mansion House. The site of Ottowa only\\nhaving been laid out in 1830, ten years since, you cannot expect many\\ndetails of its fine streets and churches; I leave that for the next\\nyear’s tourist. The buildings principally consist of shops, arranged in\\na square, upon one side of which is our hotel, and upon another side, a\\nlarge brick court-house is in progress—this being a county town. The\\nOttawans are much disappointed that the canal did not terminate at their\\ntown, instead of Peru, fifteen miles lower down the Illinois.\\nNotwithstanding this, the town must increase, and enjoys considerable\\ntrade, as it is surrounded by a good farming country, prairie and\\nwoodland, with abundance of limestone and sandstone in its vicinity. Its\\nwater power will in time render it another Rochester for the Genessee\\nfarmers, who will soon be raising their grain in the plains around.\\nBe{141}side this it is the centre of an extensive coal basin, which crops\\nout in various places in the neighborhood. Chicago now receives supplies\\nof that article here, which she once obtained from Ohio. When the\\nIllinois is high, steamboats from St. Louis reach here, but at present\\nthey ascend no higher than Peru. They gave us a very nice supper here,\\nwhich we partook in company with the boarders, travellers, and our\\ndriver. This last attacked the ham and broiled chickens right manfully,\\ndeclaring he was as hungry as a prairie wolf. Pray do not expect a bill\\nof fare at every place—suffice every thing was as good as could be\\nexpected—nay better, for who would look for such city dainties as\\norange sweetmeats and iced cakes in this young wilderness settlement.\\nEvery thing desirable can be obtained, by the steamboats here, except\\ngood cooking, and style at table—these will come in time, and their\\nabsence affords variety in our wanderings.',\n"," 'A peep at the ‘Ottowa Republican,’ and several neighboring papers,\\namused us until the stage horn sounded—we entered our stage—the\\nleaders were touched, and we bade adieu to Ottowa I fear forever. I\\nshall not soon forget that lovely purple evening, which threw such a\\ncharm over the scenery as we drove from Ottowa to Peru, a distance of\\nfifteen miles. Our road lay beside the bright Illinois, upon prairie or\\nbottom land, which lines each side of the river throughout its whole\\nlength, making a valley from one to five miles broad, skirted with high\\nlimestone and sandstone bluffs. The ground was gay with flowers, and as\\nthe twilight threw its purple haze over the opposite shore, it became\\nalive with hundreds of brilliant fire flies, larger and more luminous\\nthan any I{142} had ever seen. Many a time have you and I sat in our early\\ndays upon the banks of the Passaic, watching these brilliant creatures\\nas they starred the black robe of night, but we never beheld them so\\nlarge, and dazzling as these western lights. The river was as smooth as\\na mirror, upon which was reflected the trees and rocks with perfect\\ndistinctness, but it had a darker hue than those bright waters we had\\npassed, being tinted with a brownish topaz. I remarked this to my\\ncompanion, who attributed its dark shade to the alluvion and black mould\\nthrough which it flowed. ‘It cannot be wholesome,’ I said, ‘I should not\\nlike to drink it.’ ‘I guess if you had been on top of that rock three\\nhundred years ago,’ said an old man who sat opposite me, peering out the\\nstage at the opposite bluffs, ‘you’d been glad to drink it ever so muddy\\nor unhealthy.’ I opened my eyes and stared enquiringly at him. ‘That’s\\nthe rock where the Ingins were starved to death,’ he said in answer to\\nmy look. ‘Indeed!’ I exclaimed, ‘Is that starved rock?’ Our heads were\\nout the window, and we looked with much interest upon the scene of that\\nIndian tragedy. A high cliff of alternate sandstone and limestone\\nlayers, stands out like a turret from the rocky bluffs one hundred and\\nforty feet above the river—it was spotted with moss, and fringed with\\ntrees, which the sun’s last rays had tinged with gold, and amber, and\\nrose. ‘Yes, ma’am, that’s the rock,’ continued our fellow traveller.\\n‘Down to the river they sunk their kettles with bark ropes, in hopes of\\ngetting water, but the cruel Pottawattamies cut the strings, and so they\\ndied.’ And so they died! What images of anguish, sorrow, rage and\\ndespair, does that short sentence convey to our minds!{143}',\n"," 'The fate of the unhappy band of Illini, who dwelt in the fair land which\\nhas taken their name, has been related by Schoolcraft and Flint; but as\\nI think you have not seen their works, I will tell it you. The Illini\\nwere defeated in battle by the Pottowattamies, and retreated to the top\\nof this rock, which by a narrow ledge joins the land. This spot they\\ndefended some time, but at length their provisions and water failed.\\nThey scorned to surrender, but one by one lay down in dignified\\ncomposure, and, like Cæsar, drawing their mantles over them, died in\\nsilence. The last one who had defended the rock at length expired, and\\nthe enemy seeing no one appear, entered the strong-hold to find them all\\nat rest. Their bones repose there now. The rock is passed, and upon the\\nprairie at our right we behold the brazen glare of a fire lighting up a\\ndozen dark figures which are flitting around it. This is an emigrant\\nbivouac. Some of their wagons taken from their wheels shelter the center\\nwhere the men repose; the women and children remain in the other\\nvehicles. A fire in the midst keeps off the moschetoes, and perhaps a\\nprairie wolf, thus affording under the mild sky a comfortable place of\\nrepose without the expense of a hotel. The prairie grass forms a soft\\nbed for the men, and food for the cattle.',\n"," '‘I reckon the Ottowa folks are pretty considerably nettled,’ said our\\nold traveller, in a voice which rendered ‘night hideous’ with its\\nharshness. ‘They thought the canal would end there, and they would git\\nall the trade.’ ‘The Ottowa folks don’t depend on no canals, I guess,’\\nreplied another passenger, apparently a neighboring farmer, taking up\\nthe cudgels for his{144} favorite town. ‘Ottawa’s a great and increasing\\nplace, which will beat Chicorgo yet. Wait a while and you’ll see rows\\nof factories and mills upon the Fox, and you’ll see the rapids scooped\\nout below, so that the steamboats can come up at all times, and then I\\nwouldn’t give a cent for your Peru. Ottawa folks keep their eyes skinned\\nI tell you!’ ‘Oh! you prairie chickens crow loud; you are always laying\\nout for mills to grind the grain what you mean to raise. You’d better\\ncome and open a shop now, or a bank, at Peru; things will rise when old\\nTippecanoe comes to the white house.’ ‘Tip me none of your old ginerals,\\nif you please,’ said his opponent. ‘Van’s the man for me. Give me Van\\nBuren for President and things will rise enough.’ The gurgling of water,\\nas we forded the Little Vermillion, drowned the noise of these village\\npoliticians much to my comfort. Soon after we found ourselves in the\\nmidst of a group of Irish shantees, occupied by the canal laborers,\\nflanked by a row of low wooden tenements, upon the bank of the\\nmoon-illumined Illinois. ‘This, ladies and gentlemen,’ said the farmer,\\nin a tone of derision, ‘is the grand town of Peru!’ ‘Yes, and bigger\\nthan Ottawa was, when it was as newly settled as Peru,’ answered the\\nPeruvian disdainfully. As I looked around me, I thought of Tinkerville\\nand its public square in the forest; but every thing must have a\\nbeginning. The steamboat frontier was waiting to receive us, and we were\\nsoon, with our luggage, translated to her deck. Fatigued as we were we\\ncould not leave the deck for some time, for the night sun, as the\\nIndians call the moon, was shining brightly down upon the smooth surface\\nof the Illinois, lighting up her forest glades as we{145} passed, and\\nthrowing fantastic shadows over the silver water. However, a night and a\\nday in a stage coach has beaten all romance out of us, and we at length\\nretreated to our snug state-room. The mosquitoe nets were drawn over us,\\nand we soon bid to nature and to you a fair good-night.{146}',\n"," '\\nPeoria, July 8th.\\n',\n"," 'My dear E.—We were detained during the night by a heavy fog, and\\ninstead of reaching Peoria at six, found at breakfast we were many miles\\nthis side of it. Breakfast over, I have seated myself upon the guards, a\\nsort of balcony which runs around the outside of the steamboat, and with\\nnote-book in hand am prepared to give you a faithful picture of all I\\nsee. The river is still and bright, reflecting every little twig and\\nleaf. There is no villa, or ruins, or lordly mansion to embellish the\\nscenery, but it is indebted to its wild forests alone for its\\nloveliness. It flows and bends in a very graceful manner around the soft\\ngreen islets, or low points fringed with trees of new and unknown form\\nand beauty. Frowning above the trees in the back ground are the cliffs,\\nwaterworn as if once the river’s ancient bound. Occasionally our track\\nlay close to the shore, and we gazed into the forest’s deep recesses;\\nnow a dark jungle is before us, haunt of the wolf and the panther; and\\nagain, a{147} noble grove of witch elms, or long vistas through which the\\nearly morning sun was streaming, or a patch of brilliant smooth sward\\nsurrounded by a circle of trees, the papaw, or the silvery barked white\\nmaple, its bright green leaves turning up their silver lining to the\\nbreeze. Sometimes a little bay appeared between two promontories,\\ncovered with yellow and white water lillies, and the perfumed nymphea\\nodorata, the home of the swan or the wild fowl. The willow here occurs\\nfrequently, dipping its leaves in the stream; sometimes the shining\\nwillow with its long and slender brilliant leaves. The locust is\\nfrequent; many varieties of oak, the red bud, cotton wood, and many\\nother trees festooned with vines of every tint and variety.',\n"," 'I wished much to see a prairie wolf, and looked out eagerly among the\\nforests in vain. Just now a man who was looking to the shore exclaimed\\n‘There’s a wolf!’ he pointed to the spot, where some dark animal was\\ncowering under a log. My companion declared it was a pig, and some one\\nelse a dog, whatever it was, it soon run away into the forest. I\\ndeclared it should be a wolf, and to please me, it was unanimously voted\\na prairie wolf. A deer I looked for in vain; the noise made by our\\npuffing high pressure engine, being sufficient to scare every animal\\naway from our path. We passed Hennepin during the night, and this\\nmorning Lacon and Rome, both small places, situated upon those elevated\\nbanks or plateaus, which alternate with the woodlands along the river.\\nThe two first are both in Putman county containing two hundred and\\nfifty-two square miles, and a population of two thousand one hundred\\nand{148} thirty-one. The stream which had become narrower, about a quarter\\nof a mile in width; now swelled out in an expanse two miles broad and\\ntwenty long, called Peoria lake, by the indians Pin-a-ta-wee. It abounds\\nwith fish we were told, as sturgeon, buffalo, perch, pickerel, and cat\\nfish and the alligator, garr, seven feet long, covered with scales, the\\nformer we had often seen during the morning, spring from the water, and\\nplunge back again leaving a silvery circle growing wider and wider upon\\nthe polished surface of the river. The water was now unruffled by a\\nripple, the shore at our left covered with forests throwing their\\nshadows over the water while upon a high bank at our right, was the\\npretty town of Peoria. It was a very sweet and tranquil picture. This\\nhas ever been a favorite haunt of the Indians and French. In 1779 a\\nvillage stood here called La Ville de Maillet, inhabited by French\\ncourier des bois, Indian hunters, and fur traders, a stopping place for\\nthe French upon the lakes and their settlements on the Mississippi.\\nSubsequently Fort Clarke was erected here for the United States troops,\\nand now a pretty town with six houses of worship, several acadamies,\\nmarket houses, shops, hotels, breweries, mills, and dwellings and a\\nhandsome court-house with pillared portico and tin covered cupola have\\narisen upon the bank. The shore is composed of pebbles, about twenty\\nfeet high, extending back one quarter of a mile, where another step of\\nsix or ten feet brings you to a fine prairie, leading to the bluffs. A\\nrow of buildings surmounted the banks principally shops, but among them\\nwe observed several small taverns, as the Napoleon Coffee House, Union\\nHotel, and Washington Hall. Upon a brick{149} house farther in town my\\ncompanion espied the sign of the Clinton Hotel, which being the house to\\nwhich he had been recommended, he accepted the services of the porters\\nof that establishment, who with those of the other houses had been\\nsoliciting his custom. How to land, was the next consideration, for upon\\nrivers which have so great a rise and fall, it is difficult to construct\\nwharves. After grounding, backing fastening a stake in the mud for a\\nrope, which immediately came out again, we were at last stationary. A\\nplank was then projected to the shore, down which we were all trundled.\\nWe had now reached the end of our journey, one hundred and seventy miles\\nfrom Chicago, and took leave of the Chicago line, being left to our own\\ndevices to wander farther. We found the Clinton hotel a good house, and\\ncharges low, being only one dollar and twenty-five cents a day each. The\\nhost is a very gentlemanly person, and the ladies of the family well\\neducated and agreeable. We partook of a very good dinner of native\\nproduce, even to the wild raspberry tarts, which appeared at desert. I\\nlike this much more than being fed upon foreign dainties which one can\\nprocure any where. There was a picture in our dining room which was a\\ncomplete sign of the times; upon it was painted a cider barrel, from\\nwhich a man was drawing ‘hard cider,’ bearing the motto, ‘Old Tip’s\\nclaims to the White House cannot be jumped.’ This had been borne as a\\nbanner by the Peoria delegation at the whig convention of Fort Meigs. If\\none might judge by what one sees, Gen. Harrison will have the votes of\\nall the west, as he seems to be very popular as far as we have been.\\nUpon returning to the parlor we found a centre table{150} containing\\nannuals, and several excellent volumes of the best authors, bearing the\\nnames of the young ladies of the house. While I looked over these, my\\ncompanion took up the Peoria Democrat, and expressed his surprise to see\\nsuch a paper in so new a place, and in it such proofs of the trade of\\nthe place. The type and paper were as good as any in our city, and\\ncontained advertisements of goods, drugs, wines, fruits, and other\\narticles, which makes one wonder how such things could find their way\\nthere. Another column explains this, where are notices of steamboats\\nwhich ply between this place and St. Louis, but three or four days\\nvoyage to New Orleans; consequently, one may command any thing here. In\\nthree years the Michigan canal will be finished, which will open a\\ncommunication with the Atlantic through the lakes and the New York\\ncanals. Peoria cannot fail of being a place of much business, for\\nbesides the above named advantages, the land around it is rich prairie,\\ninterspersed with wood land, or timber, as they call it here, crossed by\\nseveral mill streams. It is but seventy miles from Springfield, the\\ncapitol of Illinois, a large and handsome town, doing a great deal of\\nbusiness, and situated in the celebrated county of Sangamon.',\n"," 'Over the level country around Peoria good roads are laid out in every\\ndirection. A railroad is in contemplation from hence to the Mississippi\\nat Warsaw, while another, the Bloomington and Peoria railroad, is soon\\nto be laid down from this to the Mackinaw river, forty miles. It is on\\nthe high road from the gulf of Mexico to the north, and already\\ntravellers are taking this route to the eastern States. We found{151} here a\\nyoung lady and her father who had come from Mobile. They left there in a\\nsteamboat for New Orleans, from thence other steamboats brought them up\\nthe Mississippi to Quincy, from whence they rode in a stage to Peoria.\\nThey were on their way to New York, and had taken this rout from its\\nnovelty. In the afternoon we ramble down to the shores, where I found\\nsome very pretty pieces of agate, jasper, and other pretty pebbles, and\\ngathered several singular shells and flowers. The shells were\\nprincipally large muscle, lined with pearl, some of them beautifully\\nirredescent. A neat cottage on the bank with its door open looked so\\ninviting that we ventured to enter and ask for a glass of water. The\\nwoman willingly filled a pitcher from a cool spring near, and invited us\\nto sit down. She looked ill, and the children around her were thin and\\npale. I asked her the cause, and heard a sad story of fever and ague\\nsickness. They had removed from Pennsylvania, and had all been ill as\\nsoon as they arrived, but had hopes of being after a while acclimated.\\nThe cause of their sickness was as usual, their exposure to the heavy\\nfogs which arise from this river at night, which strangers should avoid\\nfor a year at least—and probably other imprudence. Her husband was a\\ncarpenter, who had sufficient employment where they had lived, and there\\nthey were well and happy. To my question of the cause of their removal\\nshe answered, ‘Oh, he had heard of the west, where every one is sure to\\nget rich, and so he came.’ Most of the emigrants we have met with could\\ngive us no better reason for removing hither than this woman. They hear\\nthe west spoken of as a great, rich, and rising country;{152} pull up their\\nhousehold by the roots, and, ‘westward hold their way.’ I believe no one\\nbut our people can thus readily leave their homes, and the graves of\\ntheir fathers to seek a residence in new and untried regions. Among the\\nemigrants, we were often surprised to see so many from the neighboring\\nStates. Hoffman met a man during his ‘winter in the west,’ who had\\nremoved his household from one end of the State of Michigan to the\\nother, merely because, the mould was a foot richer at Kalamazoo—his own\\nbeing eighteen inches. A man removes from the eastern border to the west\\nof Pennsylvania. Perhaps he there erects a house and in a few years sees\\na good farm around him; another wishing to remove west, offers him a sum\\nfor it, so much larger than his original outlay, that he is tempted to\\nsell, and emigrate farther west. He with this money purchases a place of\\na man in Ohio, who sells in the same way and passes on. In a few years\\nthe Pensylvanian again sells, and again removes, so that there is a\\nconstant stream going step by step to fill up the immense plains and\\nvalleys which here abound. Fashions for emigration prevail; a place\\nbecomes popular; every one is excited by the accounts of this new\\nDorado, and westward ho! is the cry. Boon’s, Lick in Missouri, Salt\\nriver, Platte river, Oregon, Rock river, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa,\\neach have had its run, and its partisans. But there is ‘more than meets\\nthe ear,’ in this; fortunately their destinies are not left to the\\nguidance of their own variable fancies. There is an overruling Power, at\\nwhose command their steps are hither bent. When I see them on their\\nmarch; people from every nation, men, women, and little ones, and cattle\\nwinding down{153} the road in their wagons, filling the steamboats, and\\ncrowding the stages, all pressing in large bodies towards the land of\\nmilk and honey, they remind me of the Hebrews plucked up from an\\nover-grown country, and led with an Almighty hand, to the land of\\npromise. May these travellers, study the eventful journey of the\\nPalestine emigrants, and shun those errors by which they were driven\\nforth from its fair fields. The Hebrews were told, if they would obey\\ntheir heavenly leader, ‘the land shall yield her increase, and the trees\\nof the field shall yield their fruit’—and ‘ye shall eat your bread to\\nthe full and dwell in the land safely,’ and ‘ye shall lie down and none\\nshall make you afraid’; ‘I will be your God and ye shall be my\\npeople.’[17] What magnificent promises! And how powerful the promiser!\\nOh that these people would lay these words to their heart, and consider\\nwell the Hebrew’s fate! They were also promised to be made ‘high above\\nall nations which He hath made, in praise, in name, and in honor.’[18]\\nThere be those who predict this for our country; let these read the\\nconditions by which this maybe obtained, and dread curses[19] which\\nawait a failure! We continued our stroll, back of the town across the\\nprairie, or steppe upon which it is built, to another about twelve or\\nfifteen feet above it. From thence is a fine plateau which reaches to\\nthe bluffs. As we sat upon this eminence the view was very pretty. The\\nsun had been long gone, but a delicate amber shaded with purple tinted\\nevery thing. Below us, was the green prairie crossed with dark purple\\npaths over which the ‘lowing herds’ were winding slowly, as if loth to\\nleave their free pastures{154} for the confinement of a barn yard. The\\ncattle raised upon prairie grass are very fat, and the Illinois beef\\ncommands a ready sale in the New Orleans markets. The butter and milk we\\nmet with here was uncommonly rich, equal to our first rate Goshen\\nbutter. Beyond the prairie is the town, beneath which, flows the quiet\\nIllinois, bounded by dark forests and elevated bluffs. While we were\\nthus sitting enjoying the ‘coming on of grateful evening mild,’ the deep\\nsilence was broken by the sweet sound of a church bell, echoing over the\\nriver and the still forests. At once these words of Milton so very\\nappropriate to our situation sprang to our lips;',\n"," 'There was apparently an evening meeting about to be held, and we\\nrejoiced we should be enabled to enter the courts of the Lord, a\\nprivilege we had been denied for some time. Our path to the town lay\\npast several very pretty cottage residences, ornamented with shrubbery\\nand flowers—thence, following the sound of the bell we found ourselves\\nbefore a small meeting house. It happened fortunately to be the meeting\\nwhich enjoyed the administration of the Rev. Mr. S——g, of the\\npresbyterian persuasion, whom we found to be a very pleasing,\\nintelligent, and pious man. We were very much gratified with his\\ndiscourse, which we found very appropriate. He spoke of man as a\\ntraveller, the end of whose journey must certainly one day approach, and\\nearnestly bade us to take thought for that event, as there were many\\nthere who ‘before the frost is spread over our prairie, may{155} be lying\\nunder its sod.’ He reminded us much of Amos, the herdsman of Tekoa, for\\nhis similies were all drawn from rural objects—the sun, the clouds, the\\nprairie, the river, and the scenery around him. We no longer wondered at\\nthe accounts we had received of the high religious and moral standing of\\nthe place, and the great amount of good done in it. This last year,\\ntwenty-three thousand dollars were contributed by the people of Peoria\\ntowards charitable and religious institutions. We walked home under a\\nbright moon, our hearts much refreshed by all we had heard, and we were\\nrejoiced the Lord had placed such a faithful servant in these fair\\nprairies, to uphold his name.',\n"," 'July 9th.—While wandering along the shore this morning, we descried\\nthe smoke of our expected steamboat, and hastened back to the hotel to\\npack our trunks. It was the Home, from Peru to St. Louis, and we were to\\ntake passage in her for Alton, on the Mississippi. We bade adieu to\\nsweet Peoria with regret. The remembrance of it will long ‘perfume our\\nminds,’ as old Izaak Walton says. Its situation, its excellent society,\\nand religious privileges, and its good schools, must certainly make it a\\ndesirable place of residence, or of trade. It is two hundred miles from\\nSt. Louis, and one hundred and seventy from Chicago. When in the saloon\\nof the Home we were presented with a book in which to write our names,\\nplace of residence, whither bound, and our politics. While leaving\\nthis, our eyes fell upon a piece of pink satin, framed, which hung\\nagainst the wall, upon which was printed the rules of the boat. Among\\nother things it forbid ‘any gentleman to go to table without his{156} coat,\\nor any other garb to disturb the company. No gentleman must pencil-work\\nor otherwise injure the furniture.’ (I suppose whittling was meant. Upon\\nour lake boat we saw the boxes of merchandize and barrels on deck, fast\\ndisappearing under the whittling knife. A piece a foot long and two\\ninches wide would be torn from the box and cut to pieces by a restless\\npassenger.) Beside these, we were told ‘no gentleman was to lie down in\\na berth with his boots on, and none enter the ladies’ saloon without\\npermission from them.’ We found in this boat, three indications of being\\nnear the south, liquors upon the table, gambling in the gentlemen’s\\ncabin, and a black chambermaid slave to the captain. Among the\\npassengers, were a man with his wife and sons, unlike the most I had\\nmet, going west, but making a retrograde motion to the east. They were\\ndriven away they said by the fever and ague, from which they had been\\nsuffering ever since their removal west. Their yellow gaunt appearance\\nfully testified to the truth of this. He had been a shop keeper in the\\nState of New York, who experiencing some reverses, was persuaded to\\nremove to this golden region by his wife, who was now no longer able to\\nlead the village fashions. He bought a lot, and mill privilege, in an\\nembryo town—their house was situated under the boughs of a forest\\nimpenetrable to the sunbeams, surrounded by decaying leaves, moist new\\nsoil, and a mill pond. The town’s people were too busily occupied in\\nbuilding banks and hotels, to dig wells, and drinking out of the marshy\\nsprings, of course all fell ill by turns. Their boy, they said, had been\\nat ‘death’s door,’ and now, although better, was afflicted with an ague\\ncake, which they wished me{157} to feel in his side. I am convinced a\\nlittle prudence and knowledge, will keep many ‘healthy, wealthy, and\\nwise,’ who, without it are easily discouraged, fall into difficulties,\\nand wish to try a new place. We have met many upon the road, who have\\nnearly equalled the old woman on the prairie, who had begun the world\\nseven times.',\n"," 'The other female passenger was a young girl who had come down the river\\nin the boat, her home being on the prairie, back of Peru. She was a\\npretty innocent country lassie about sixteen, travelling alone, on a\\nvisit to a brother living on the river, whose wife was ill and required\\nher services. Her travelling dress was a muslin striped with pink; and\\nher hat one of that description we call Dutch bonnets, made of\\npasteboard covered with pink glazed gingham. She was rejoiced to examine\\nmy wardrobe, and cut new patterns, as she lives far from the haunts of\\nmen and mantua-makers. My Mosaic brooch pleased her much, and she asked\\nme if I had bought it of the pedlar who she heard had lately arrived in\\nthat part of the country with a lot of new goods, and whom she was eager\\nto see. I was obliged to say I had not purchased it from that\\nfashionable depositary. She then proposed to show me her clothes; mine\\nbeing new to her, she supposed her’s must be new and desirable to me. At\\nher request the chamber-maid drew from the state-room a huge chest of\\nblack walnut, which she opened, and, among other things, displayed a\\npretty straw bonnet trimmed with gay ribbons and flowers. That was her\\nSunday bonnet. She also drew forth a topaz pin which had reached here in\\na pedlar’s cart, and was a present to her by her brother. ‘This pin has\\nlasted{158} wonderfully,’ she said, ‘considering how much it has been\\nborrowed. At every dance or party when I do not go, some of the girls\\nborrow and wear it. It has been lent for ten miles around.’ This young\\nlady had been brought when quite young, by her family, from Ohio, whence\\nthey emigrated here. They had all suffered much from the fever and ague,\\nbut were now acclimated, or rather had corrected the causes of their\\nagues, and she had become fat and rosy. I have remarked in several\\ninstances, that the children born here, or brought here young, grow up\\nstrong and ruddy, and their parents suffer the most. It is only the\\nfirst generation who lose their health, as the land improves and\\ndiseases vanish about their homes by the time their children are grown.\\nThis family live upon a large and productive farm which yields, among\\nother things, according to her account, four hundred bushels of peaches.\\nIn the season of this delicious fruit her mother gives a peach feast,\\ninviting all their friends and acquaintances, who, after eating as much\\nas they like, carry away each a basket full. Her family sell several\\nbarrels of dried peaches every year.',\n"," 'Twelve miles below Peoria we stopped at the town of Pekin, built upon a\\nbank elevated fifteen feet above the water during high tide; but now,\\nall these places are much higher. The captain told us he should be here\\nsome time taking in merchandize, and we employed the interval in seeing\\nthe lions of the town. I told the little country girl our intention.\\n‘Lions!’ she said, ‘I guess you mean wolves; there are no lions in these\\nparts.’',\n"," 'Pekin is a small place and only contains eight or{159} nine hundred\\ninhabitants, and five or six streets. The shops seemed well filled with\\ngoods, and presented a goodly show of tin, iron-ware, dry-goods,\\ncrockery, provisions, etc. I purchased a green gauze veil here and\\nseveral small articles, all of which I found much more expensive than in\\nour Atlantic shops, freight being high on the Mississippi. In paying for\\nthem I found a new currency here, my shillings and sixpences being\\ntransformed into bits and pics or picayunes. The Pekin Express lay\\nupon the counter which we amused ourselves looking over while waiting\\nfor change. The person who kept the shop turned out to be the oldest\\ninhabitant of the place, that important personage who, in a storm,\\nalways determines if there has been ever a greater one or no. He might\\nvery well be the oldest, as the town is but ten years in existence.\\n‘Pekin,’ he said, ‘would have been ere this far ahead of any town upon\\nthe river, were it not that there were two parties among the\\ncommissioners who were to lay it out; these pulling different ways the\\ntown was nearly lost between them. The rich country behind, and the\\nriver in front, had befriended them, and they soon expected to have\\ntheir branch of the railroad finished to Mackinaw river, whose water\\npower and timber bluffs were very valuable.’ We remarked as we walked, a\\nlarge hotel nearly finished; a presbyterian, methodist, and several\\nother meeting-houses; office of the ‘Tazewell Telegraph’; academy, and\\nsome dwellings. We lay here four hours with a hot sun reflecting from\\nthe sandy bank, impatiently watching the barrels of flour which seemed\\nas they would never cease rolling from the large store-house upon the\\nbank, down to our vessel. These barrels are{160} from the steam flour mills,\\nwhich turn out two hundred barrels a day. Beside these, we took in a\\nhundred sacks of corn, and some other merchandize. The captain seemed\\nwell pleased with his morning’s work, saying he had a streak of luck\\nthat day. Three miles below this he had another ‘streak.’ At the mouth\\nof Mackinaw river scows were waiting him, loaded with bundles of laths\\nand staves, and long dark boards, which I took for mahogany, but which\\nproved to be black-walnut. The Mackinaw is a clear stream, having rich\\nbottom land, bounded by bluffs covered with white oak and cedar. The\\nprairies through which it flows, are rolling and tolerable land with\\nseveral mill seats.',\n"," 'The Illinois looked beautiful this afternoon. Its glassy waters scarcely\\nmoved, and it seemed so content with its sweet resting place, and at the\\nsilent admiration of those stately trees, which were sending their cool\\nflickering shadows over her and gazing down at loveliness, that it would\\nfain linger upon its course, as some young languid beauty, conscious of\\na graceful position which is winning admiring glances from every\\nbeholder.',\n"," 'Among the trees, beside the usual elm, oak and maple, we observed\\nseveral enormous wild cherry trees, nearly one hundred feet in height,\\nand at least fifteen feet in circumference, and the paw paw, the coffee\\nnut, the red ash, American nettle, a tall, slender tree, with pretty red\\nberries, and many unknown to us, or to those around us. The islands in\\nthis river are small but covered with soft, luxurious herbage. The birds\\nand wild fowl were out, enjoying themselves, chattering, pluming their\\nwings, and visiting each{161} other from tree to tree. Among the wild fowl,\\nwe observed teal and brant, and wild ducks, skimming over the water, or\\nwheeling in flocks over our heads. One, apparently in a spirit of\\ndaring, would set out to cross our path—leaving his little cove, he\\nwould glide with the utmost rapidity over the river in front of us,\\nleaving a silver line on the smooth surface of the stream, and after we\\nhad passed, glide back, bobbing up and down upon the waves in our wake.\\nWhen he arrived at home, what a quacking and chattering and fluttering\\nwas heard! In one little cove, or bayou, was a little island, covered\\nwith rich grass, and shaded from the sun by the dense grove whose\\nbranches met over it—this seemed to be quite a colony of ducks, who\\nwere going and coming in rapid but graceful evolutions from the main\\nland. A young man who stood near us named the place Quackville, and\\ndeclared when he returned home he would publish a map, and sell off the\\nlots. We passed several towns to day, as Liverpool, Havanna,\\nBeardstown—the former a small settlement, but which its inhabitants\\nintend to make larger, as they have already a railroad in contemplation\\nacross the Mississippi. Beardstown is a place of some importance. It is\\na county town, and its commerce greater than any upon the river.\\nMechanics of all descriptions are to be found here, as bakers, shoe\\nmakers, tailors, blacksmiths, cabinet makers, silver smiths, carpenters,\\njoiners, coopers, painters &c. &c. see Peck. There are also here steam\\nflour mills, saw mills, breweries, distilleries, &c. A canal is\\nprojected here, to connect the Illinois with the Wabash, (which divides\\nthe state of Illinois from Indiana,) by means of the Sangamon and\\nVermillion{162} forks. While passing these towns one is surprised at their\\nrapid growth, for when Schoolcraft rowed his canoe up this river twenty\\nyears since, it was a wilderness only inhabited by Indians. Opposite\\nHavanna, the Spoon river enters the Illinois. Its Indian name is\\nAmequeon, which means ladle, and is much prettier than its present\\nname. It is one hundred and forty miles in length, navigable most of the\\nway, and capable of being cleared further. The soil is dry undulating\\nprairie, with considerable timber—and some of it upon the forks of the\\nSpoon is the richest in the state—its forks and tributaries affording\\ngood mill seats. It is in the military bounty land, which commences just\\nabove it, and terminates at the junction of the Illinois with the\\nMississippi, making a triangle of five million three hundred and sixty\\nthousand acres, about ninety miles along the Illinois, and the base of\\nthe triangle, ninety miles across to the Mississippi, near Quincy. This\\nis appropriated by Congress to the soldiers of the regular army in the\\nwar between the United States and Great Britain. Two thirds of this land\\nis prairie, and the rest timbered, crossed by a variety of rivers and\\ncreeks. The soil is generally a black vegetable mould from fifteen to\\nthirty inches deep. Much of the best of this land has been bought up by\\na company who have opened an office at Quincy, where they sell it from\\nthree to ten dollars an acre, while other parts are sold at the price\\ngovernment established for its lands all over the States, one dollar and\\ntwenty-five cents an acre. Government has given to the State of Illinois\\nevery other section. Sangamon river comes gliding down over its pebbly\\nfloor, a pure transparent stream, between Liverpool and Havanna. It runs\\nthrough Sangamon county, of whose{163} fertility, beautiful scenery, crowded\\npopulation, rich prairies, numerous streams, and valuable timber groves,\\nwe have heard such flourishing accounts. By the way, I can never get\\nreconciled to the western custom of calling woods timber, woodland, or\\ngroves, or forest, timberland. My young country girl, Maria, in relating\\nan interesting romantic event which had occurred in her region of\\ncountry, instead of speaking of a ramble in the woods said ‘we had gone\\nto walk in the timber.’ In this famed county is Springfield, the capital\\nof the State. The Sangamon river is one hundred and eighty miles long,\\nand navigable nearly to the capitol, seventy-five miles, by small\\nsteamboats. With a small expense it can be cleared. We do not see the\\nIllinois in all its grandeur, as the water is low. It falls, our captain\\nsays, one and a half inches a day, and has fallen eight feet since June.\\nIt will arise in the autumn, and when its present channel is full\\noverflows the bottom land to the bluffs. This makes the river shore,\\nunless very elevated, rather unhealthy, and consequently uninhabited.\\nSoon after passing the Sangamon, we stopped to take in wood, and we\\nembraced the opportunity to take a sunset stroll in the forest. A small\\ncottage embowered among woodpiles, inhabited by a woodman and his\\nfamily, were the only signs of human life we saw. These sylvan solitudes\\nhowever, are not without their denizens, for the birds were skipping\\nfrom bough to bough, the turtle were romantically reclining upon the\\nlogs beside the water, the wild fowls, and the paroquets were chattering\\nin concert with the mocking bird. There the squirrel also',\n"," 'Here however in these pretty nooks he sits undisturbed, for no boys\\n‘with crooks and bags’ can molest his quiet haunts. We enjoyed the deep\\nforest walk very much having been now so long cramped in a steamboat,\\nand wandered along among the stately beech and graceful linden, the\\nblack walnut and locust, swung upon the festoons of the enormous vines\\nwhich hung down from the trees, and breathed with much satisfaction the\\nperfume from the dewy herbage, grape vine buds, and yellow jassamin\\nwhich climbed the boughs around us. The steamboat bell recalled us to\\nthe shore in time to see a steamboat pass, being the second we had met\\nthis morning.',\n"," 'There is much travelling upon this river during the summer months. Our\\ncaptain told us he had made fifty-eight trips last year from St. Louis\\nto Peru, carrying ten thousand passengers. This seems a great number,\\nbut we are a travelling people, and with the emigrants going west, it\\nmay be true. I am chary of repeating things heard upon the road as I\\nknow my country people delight in quizzing travellers. I have had some\\nawful examples of this lately, sufficient to make me cautious, in regard\\nto certain tourists from abroad to this country; and when told any thing\\ndubious, remember the three miles of roast pig; the drunken ladies of\\nBoston; the piano with pantalets upon its legs; the canvass bags to\\nhold specie in times of bank troubles, etc. etc. Pretty Maria’s\\ntravelling bonnet, which I described to you, also reminds me of the\\nmisconceptions to which travellers are liable, who take a hasty glance\\nand go not to the best sources for information. As proof of the poverty\\nof the country, low style of dress and manners, an European traveller{165}\\ntells his readers the richest ladies wear hats of their own manufacture,\\nmade of pasteboard covered with calico or gingham. And so they do; but\\nonly to run in the garden, or to a neighbor in the county, for you know\\nwe all, when in the county, use these as garden hats, as they shelter\\nthe face so well from the sun. I wish you could transport yourself here\\nat this moment, and seat yourself by me upon the hurricane deck, and see\\nhow perfectly the forest shore is reflected upon the quiet polished\\nIllinois. This stream cannot be called a flowing one for it has scarcely\\nany current, but reposes in its bed with the tranquility of a lake. Now\\nit lies in evening’s deep shadow, while, as we look above, the topmost\\nplumage is tipt with gold—this gradually disappears,—darkness\\nsucceeds, except where one struggling moon-beam, from the Indians Tibic\\ngeezis, night sun, streams down the long forest vista, and lies like a\\nsilver ribbon across the river. I always go to bed with the chickens\\nwhile on board a steamboat, as a light attracts mosquetoes, and here\\nriver fog forbids us to sit out of doors—so good night.',\n"," 'July 10.—Off Meredosia. This is a thriving town, built upon one of\\nthose elevated terraces which occur frequently along the river as if on\\npurpose to raise the settlements above the damp alluvion, and to give\\nthem a pretty effect. It is in a good situation to rise, as it is a sort\\nof business port to Jacksonville, to which a railroad of twenty-three\\nmiles is in operation; and Morgan county, upon which it is situated, is\\na thickly peopled district, having good timbered lands, mill streams,\\nquarries of lime and free stone; and is wa{166}tered by many streams.\\nJacksonville is a large town where there are several churches, a court\\nhouse, mills and shops. The Quincy and Danville railroad passes through\\nMeredosia, to the Wabash river, two hundred and twenty miles. Through\\nthis river, communication is held with the lakes. Their exports are\\nbetween two and three hundred thousand dollars, and imports five hundred\\nthousand dollars. Here we took in several passengers. Six miles below\\nMeredosia is Naples, a small collection of shops and dwellings, situated\\nupon a high bank. Upon one house, larger than the rest, I read the name\\n‘Napoleon Coffee House.’ I looked around for Vesuvious, but saw it not,\\nnor any other Neopolitan traces. The names upon this river are very\\nludicrous, and striking monuments of the want of taste in those who\\nbestowed them. One would imagine, from reading my last letter, I had\\nbeen travelling in seven league boats, or in a balloon, as I have\\ntouched at Peru, Pekin, Havanna, Liverpool, Naples, Brussels, Rome,\\n(part in the night,) &c. While the Indian names are so pretty, why are\\nthey neglected for such worn out European designations. Peoria, and\\nIllinois, and Ottowa are very pretty; Hennipen is very well, as given in\\nhonor of one of the early discoverers of this county from France, and it\\nmight be thought a debt of gratitude, but every pioneer has not so good\\na name, and if this custom is followed, it saddles us with such names as\\nalready abound, viz: Jo Davies’ County, Pike, Cook, Higgonbottom,\\nHancock, Buggsville, Toddtown, Dodgeville. Moreover, the Indians were\\nthe first explorers, and if any, they are entitled to this honor. To\\nobviate this it has been proposed to take something local, but un{167}less\\npersons of taste are consulted, we shall hear of more Bigbonelicks,\\nBloodyruns, Mud Lakes or Crab Orchard’s. I wish Congress would take the\\nmatter in hand, and form a committee of nomanclature to name every new\\nsettlement.',\n"," 'We are constantly passing steamboats. In 1836, at Beardstown, there were\\nfour hundred and fifty arrivals and departures, and at Naples their\\naccount was the first year, 1828, nine; from March to June, 1832, one\\nhundred and eight, and now, of course all these figures must be doubled.\\nAmong our passengers we have an old Kentucky woman, who has been living\\nseveral years upon this river. She was so rejoiced to see a slave again,\\nthat soon she and Violette, our chambermaid, became quite intimate\\nfriends. She frequently borrowed her pipe to have a comfortable smoke\\nout upon the guards, where, with Violette beside her, she would smoke\\nand chat for hours. A lady on board, who had lately become a convert to\\ntemperance cause, was extremely offended at the sight of spirits upon\\nthe dining table. Her husband argued for their use upon the ground of\\nfrequent impure water, and fever and ague, from which the stomach is\\nfortified. The wife, however, was not convinced; when, in the midst of a\\nhigh argument, our old woman put her head in at the door, and taking out\\nher pipe, after slowly puffing off her smoke, uttered this oracular\\nsentence: ‘For my part, I think there are lots of gnats strained at, and\\nlots of camels swallowed,’—and disappeared. The husband left the\\nargument for the card table, whence he arose sometime after, grumbling\\nat his losses, and galled by the discovery that the winner was a well\\nknown black legg, whose practice{168} was to live in steamboats during\\nsummer, to fleece such silly sheep as himself. In the winter he returned\\nupon his laurels, to New Orleans or St. Louis, to revel upon his\\nwinnings.',\n"," 'This morning we passed one of those machines employed by government,\\nduring low water for the purpose of clearing away the sandbars. It is a\\nlarge wooden ark, worked by steam. A great shovel takes up the mud,\\nbrings it up, and throws it into the scow at the other side which is\\nemptied upon the shores. The State has appropriated $100,000 to\\nimprovements upon this river. There are several sandbars, and below\\nOttowa ledges of sandstone which, if removed, would render the\\nnavigation unimpeded at all seasons of the year quite to Ottowa, two\\nhundred and ten miles above the mouth of the river. We stopped so often\\nto take in freight and passengers, that we began to be fearful we should\\nnot reach the mouth of the river and behold its junction with the\\nstately Mississippi before dark—however, ‘we came a good jog’ this\\nmorning, to use our old Kentucky lady’s phrase, and now after tea we are\\nsitting upon the guards watching for it. We are continually passing\\nstreams which run into this river—Crooked creek, comes down about one\\nhundred miles through a very fertile region of country with a soil of\\nargillaceous mould from one to four feet deep.[20] Its banks are lined\\nwith oak, maple, hickory, black walnut and much other valuable timber.\\nBituminous coal, and free stone quarries are also found there. Apple\\ncreek, at whose mouth is a small settlement; Macoupin creek, its name\\ntaken from the Indian Maquapin, a water plant,{169} whose smooth leaf floats\\nupon the bayous and lakes in this region; its esculent root, after being\\nbaked under heated stones is a favorite food with the native tribes.\\nThere is a settlement upon this last named stream commenced in eighteen\\nhundred and sixteen, which then was the most northern white settlement\\nof Illinois. The population of the State four years after, in eighteen\\nhundred and twenty, was fifty-five thousand two hundred and eleven, and\\nnow, eighteen hundred and forty, it is four hundred and twenty three\\nthousand nine hundred and thirty four, a great increase in twenty years.\\nWe have now upon each hand, the two last counties which border the\\nIllinois. Green, on the east, contains excellent land, well settled by\\neastern families, many from Vermont. It is one of the richest portions\\nof land in the State, traversed by fine water courses and bounded by two\\nlarge rivers,—containing beautiful prairies, and excellent timber. In\\nthe cliffs which border the Mississippi on this county, bituminous coal\\nis found among the sandstone and limestone strata, and crystal springs\\nflow from their sides. Calhoun county on our right is the southern point\\nof the triangle containing the military bounty lands. The point where\\nthe Mississippi and Illinois meet is low prairie subjected to inundation\\nand consequently unhealthy; coal has been found here, and the large\\ntrees are famous for their honey. As we were near the mouth of the\\nriver, and my little fellow voyager, Maria, had not yet landed, I asked\\nher how far we were from her brother’s residence. She said she had been\\nlooking out for it, but every place had a different name from that of\\nher brother. I recommended her to ask the captain; he sent her word we{170}\\nhad passed it twenty miles back. Poor Maria seemed overwhelmed with\\nconsternation. The town, we found upon enquiry, was in the interior, the\\npassengers landing at an old tree upon the shore and we all now\\nremembered a plain country-man, upon the bank who made numerous signs to\\nthe steamboat, flourishing his arms frantically. Maria with the rest\\nsupposed he was in jest, or a madman, but now remembered he was like her\\nbrother, who must have seen her and motioned her to stop. Maria had\\nexpected a town, and did not imagine that her stopping place. As our\\nboat was so uncertain in its movements the poor man must have spent the\\nday upon the shore, and was now doubtless very anxious about his young\\nsister. There was nothing for her to do now but stop in the steamboat at\\nSt. Louis until its return trip. I felt sorry for the poor girl, only\\nfifteen, and thus left to the tender mercy of the world. We spoke to the\\ncaptain and chambermaid, who both promised to take charge of her and\\nland her at her brothers when he returned next week. The afternoon is\\nbeautiful; we are peeping up the forest glades, as the channel runs near\\nthe shore, or inhaling the rich perfume which the summer breeze shakes\\nout from the trees. Suddenly the forest is passed and we gaze over the\\nlow prairie which lies between the two rivers, bounded by a line of\\nround green hills which range across the country. ‘The bluffs of the\\nMississippi!’ exclaimed my companion, ‘and we soon shall see its famous\\nwaters.’ We hastened up to the hurricane deck, and placed ourselves in a\\ngood situation for beholding the scenery; a little excited at the\\nthought of looking upon the grand and celebrated stream. The Illinois{171}\\nflowed as straight and still as a canal, about four hundred yards wide,\\nwe glided over its waters and soon found ourselves in a broad majestic\\nstream which came rolling down between a range of bluffs; here, a mile\\nbroad, upon whose bosom some lonely islands stretched across from the\\nmouth of the Illinois. The view was delightful upon each side; the fair\\nplains of Missouri at our right, and upon the Illinois side, bold\\nbeautiful cliffs, or green cone like hills, covered with a soft carpet\\nof verdure, sinking down upon the east side into lovely green dells.\\nThis style of hill is called by the French, Mamelle. In one of these\\npretty nooks, nestled at the foot of a bluff, is the town of Grafton,\\nfrom whose balconies the inhabitants obtain a fine view up the\\nMississippi. This town is only a few years old, but expects soon to\\nrival Alton, as most of the travelling from the interior to the Missouri\\ntowns opposite, is through it. It has already laid out upon paper a\\nrailroad to Springfield, the capitol. The rapid tide of the ‘father of\\nwaters,’ presented a great contrast to the languid Illinois. The color\\nis brown, but of a different tint from the Illinois, being a dark coffee\\nbrown, but clear and sparkling. We looked a last farewell to the fair\\nIllinois, upon whose banks, or on whose water we had travelled for four\\ndays and four nights, a distance of nearly four hundred and fifty miles,\\nif we include the Des Plaines. The loveliness of the scenery all this\\ndistance merits the encomiums made upon it by the early French writers.\\nThis was a favorite river with the French, and La Salle, Charlevoix, and\\nMarquette, describe the beauty of its shores in glowing terms.',\n"," 'The bluffs upon the Illinois shore, as we descend the{172} Mississippi,\\nbecome more bare and precipitous, and have a waterworn appearance as if\\nthe water had once flowed along their summits. The regular\\nstratification of the sandstone and limestone of these cliffs, present\\nthe appearance of mason work, crowning the heights with castellated\\nresemblances, so that we might imagine we were passing beneath some\\nmountain fastness, with its frowning walls, dungeon keep, and warder’s\\ntower. Occasionally masses of white limestone are strewed along the\\nshore, or grouped upon the green sloping bank, as if some large city had\\nthere arisen upon the river’s side. Turning a sharp angle of one of\\nthose bluffs we found ourselves before a large imposing looking town,\\nbuilt upon the bank of the river, which came sloping down from the\\nbluffs behind. This we learned was Alton. While our crew were mooring\\nour boat upon the steep bank, we gazed with great curiosity and interest\\nupon this place, larger than any we had seen since leaving Detroit\\nfourteen hundred miles behind. To the left the rocks were crowned by a\\nlarge solid looking building which we were told was the penitentiary. In\\nfront was a row of high ware-houses made of limestone, filled with goods\\nand men; while a mass of houses and steeples at our right were brightly\\nreflecting the rays of the sinking sun. The shore presented a busy\\nscene; men and carts and horses were transporting goods or luggage, or\\nbusily employed Macadamizing the bank—a great improvement upon the\\nwharves we had passed. A large brick building at our right hand, with a\\nwhite porch and steps, bearing the sign of ‘Alton House,’ being our\\nplace of destination, we directed our course towards it. The keeper{173} of\\nthe house being absent, and it being no one’s business to take care of\\nus, we spent some time wandering about the well furnished parlors, and\\nstaring at the waiters who were washing up the tea things in the\\ndining-room, ere we could find any one to listen to our wants. We had\\nleft behind us the land where a living is only to be obtained by effort,\\nand where the landlord and porters are on the alert in order to catch\\nthe stranger and take him in. Here, the cool American manner obtains;\\nand although to the hungry, tired traveller rather annoying, yet, when\\nwe reflect upon the peace, and independence, and plenty, which produces\\nthis indifference, he will do as we did, throw himself upon a sofa, keep\\ncool, and quietly await the arrival of somebody.',\n"," 'While amusing ourselves looking around at the furniture, we observed a\\nportrait of, as we afterwards learned, the master of the house. As much\\nas we had heard of the wild independence, the devil-me-care manners of\\nour western brethren, we were here taken by surprise. He was without his\\ncoat—actually painted in his shirt sleeves—having upon his head an old\\nstraw hat! It was probably a warm day, or he was in too much of a hurry\\nto put on his coat when he went to sit; and besides, it was nobody’s\\nbusiness but his own how he was dressed, or if he were dressed at all,\\nand I suppose we may be thankful he retained his white robe ‘any way.’\\nLuxury, refinement, and conventual forms may be carried to excess; but I\\nam not prepared to say the other extreme is better. A boarder in the\\nhouse happening to stray in, we told our wants, and he kindly sent a\\nwaiter for the master of the house. He came instantly and with the\\ngreatest{174} alacrity and wish to oblige, took us up stairs. All the rooms\\nproving full or engaged, except one too small, we were directed to\\nanother house, which, after a short moonlight walk, we reached. The\\nEagle tavern, a favorite name for hotels, I think, in our country, was a\\ncomfortable house, although not pretending to the style and fashion of\\nthe Alton House. And now having finished these last few lines, while our\\nsupper was preparing, I hasten to bid you good-night.{175}',\n"," '\\nAlton, July 11th.\\n',\n"," 'My dear E.—Harassed by no compunctious visitings for the enormous\\npackage which I dismissed to you this morning through the Alton\\npost-office, I have seated myself deliberately before my little desk to\\nprepare you another. We have spent a delightful day among our friends\\nhere, and are very much pleased with the towns of Alton, for there are\\ntwo of them. We are now, four o’clock, waiting for the steamboat to take\\nus to St. Louis, and I employ the time in making a few sketches of the\\nplace for you. Alton is built as I told you, upon a sloping bank. This\\nground is very uneven, and upon some of the elevated portions are the\\npublic buildings. The churches here are well built and numerous, I think\\nseven or eight; the streets wide and airy; places reserved for public\\nsquares, and several handsome private dwellings. The town has arisen\\nrapidly, and from a small town in 1832, it has now fine streets, and\\nhouses, two hundred being built last year; merchants who transact\\nbusiness to{176} the amount of several hundred thousand dollars, and even\\nhalf a million in some instances. Eight or ten steamboats are owned\\nhere, and two railroads in contemplation, and the great national road it\\nis thought will be conducted through this place. There are several\\nreligious societies here, each having houses of worship; among them the\\nbaptist church is spoken of as being nicely fitted up in the interior;\\nit is built of stone. Every convenience and comfort of life is at hand;\\ncoal in profusion in the vicinity of the town, which is sold very cheap;\\nlimestone, freestone, and water lime, besides other mineral productions\\nabound. The markets are stored with wild game—deer, partridges, prairie\\nhen, and water-fowl; fruits both wild and cultivated; various sorts of\\nfish; corn, beef, pork, and vegetables of the finest order. Madison\\ncounty, in which it stands, is one of the richest in the State, being\\nmost of it upon the American bottom. It contains seven hundred and\\nninety square miles, and the value of its productions, exclusive of\\ncapital invested, and cost of buildings, amounts to two millions three\\nhundred and sixty-nine thousand one hundred and fifty-one dollars and\\neighty cents. Of bushels of wheat, they have raised one hundred and\\nsixty-five thousand five hundred and twenty. Corn one million three\\nhundred and four thousand three hundred and thirty-five bushels.\\nTobacco, eleven thousand two hundred and eighty pounds. Capital invested\\nin manufactures, two hundred and ten thousand four hundred and\\nthirty-five dollars. But I suppose you do not care for these details. If\\nI should come here again in a few years, I expect to see Alton three\\ntimes its size, for although it may not rival St. Louis, as the\\ninha{177}bitants imagine, it must be the most considerable place after it,\\nwest of Cincinnati. The Illinois brings to it the produce of the\\nnorthern lakes and States—the Mississippi waft to its doors the exports\\nof the west, and takes it over to the Ohio, and to the gulf of Mexico,\\nfrom which last it is only four or five days distant. The interests of\\nreligion and education employ the benevolent inhabitants to a remarkable\\ndegree and many thousands are expended every year for the furtherance of\\nthese objects. Among these are Shurtliff College, Alton Theological\\nSeminary, Alton Female Seminary. But enough of statistics, you will say,\\nand I hasten to our own personal adventures. We ordered a carriage\\nto-day to take us to Upper Alton, to visit our friends there, and were\\nquite pleased to see as nice a coach and pair of horses as we could see\\nin our own Broadway. After leaving the town we drove through some rich\\nprairie land, interspersed with trees, through which we obtained fine\\nviews of the swift rolling Mississippi, and across it the verdant plains\\nof Missouri, with green swelling hills beyond. A drive of two miles\\nbrought us to Upper Alton, a pretty small looking village, with spires\\nand neat dwellings peeping through the trees. This place is very\\npleasantly situated upon an elevated plateau of ground about two miles\\nfrom the lower town. Families here enjoy great advantages, in regard to\\nthe education of their children, as colleges and schools abound in its\\nneighborhood. The society of this place is very superior, and its\\nsituation healthy.',\n"," 'We found our friends in a large picturesque house in the cottage style,\\nsurrounded by piazzas, whose pillars were wreathed with the clustering\\nMichigan{178} rose, and shaded by the graceful cotton wood, and pretty red\\nbud and locust. Here indeed was a western paradise! upon the Mississippi\\nbanks we found realized, those visions so many have sighed after, a\\nlodge in the vast wilderness, a secluded retreat from the haunts of men,\\nwhere the confusions and follies of the world are only remembered as a\\ntroubled dream. A charming young family, and a well selected library,\\nrender this retirement most delightful. A seminary upon a new plan had\\nbeen lately erected near their abode, and with a view of showing us\\nevery thing of interest around them, our friends drove us in their\\ncarriage through a pleasant road in an oak forest, to the Monticello\\nFemale Seminary. The building is of limestone of that region, four\\nstories in height. It stands within a lawn ornamented with groups of\\ntrees, and a fine garden is laid out in the rear. This extensive\\nestablishment was founded by Benjamin Godfrey, Esq., a gentleman of\\nAlton, who, to this benevolent purpose devoted a large share of his\\nproperty. While a resident of the west, many examples had come before\\nhis eyes, of the miseries arising from the imperfect education of the\\nyoung women who settle here. The dearth of servants rendered it\\nnecessary for the young wives around him to superintend, if not assist\\nin household labor, and he saw how much better it was they should come\\nprepared for these duties, and quite able to perform them, instead of\\nwearing themselves out, and pining away over tasks, which, by being new,\\nappear much more arduous than they are in reality. As the evil lay in a\\ndefective system of education, this generous individual at once saw how\\ngreat a desideratum an institution would be, uniting useful with\\nornamental{179} accomplishments. With a public spirit to be much applauded,\\nMr. Godfrey erected this spacious building, for educating ‘wives for the\\nwest.’ Eighty young ladies is the limited number, all to be over\\nfourteen years of age. With the course of scientific study usual in\\nfemale seminaries, the pupils are taught music, instructed in religion,\\nand in various household duties. Among other lessons, they are taught\\nto set a table, arrange their rooms, even sweep and scrub them; wash,\\nstarch and iron all their clothes. Some young ladies, who had been bred\\nin idleness, or who had come from the indulgent homes of Alton, or\\nluxurious mansions of St. Louis, where slaves await their nod, were very\\nreluctant at first to undertake these menial employments; but the\\nadvantage which so good a school presented in its other departments,\\nrendered their mothers deaf to their complaints. They were soon,\\nhowever, broken in, and sing as merrily over their wash tubs, as the\\nother pupils. As gain is not the object of its generous founder, the\\nprice of admission is placed low, still there are some, whose means are\\ntoo straightened for even this, and these are allowed to pay for their\\ninstruction, by labor in the house. The eagerness to get admittance for\\nyoung persons, is very great, and many thus receive instruction who are\\nof high respectability, and are enabled to attend to the younger\\nbranches of the family, or even, if required, teach others. Some of\\nthese young persons are beneficiaries of a benevolent society, called\\nthe ‘Ladies’ Association for Educating Females.’ The object of this\\nsociety is to ‘encourage and assist young females to qualify themselves\\nfor teaching, and to aid in supporting teachers in those places{180} where\\nthey cannot otherwise be sustained.’ Young females of all ages are\\nselected from poor families and placed in schools, where they are\\nwatched over by these benevolent ladies, their tuition paid, and to\\neach, every year, is addressed a circular letter of advice, with the\\ndonation of an appropriate, instructive book. When prepared, they are\\nplaced in situations where they can support themselves. Several have\\nbecome missionaries, and at this school are two of the Cherokee tribe\\nwho are preparing to be teachers among their people. The great amount of\\ngood performed by these ladies entitle them to the hearty wishes of the\\nbenevolent and patriotic. The Rev. J. Spalding, in his address before\\nthe seventh annual meeting at Jacksonville, says: ‘Since its\\ncommencement it has aided one hundred and forty-seven young ladies in\\ntheir preparation for usefulness and heaven, thirty-one of whom are\\nprofessed followers of the Lamb.’ Now that I have thoroughly described\\nthe institution, we will leave the carriage and enter the house. We were\\nshown into a neatly furnished parlor, where we were soon joined by the\\nprincipal of Monticello, the Rev. Theron Baldwin, a gentleman of great\\ninformation and piety. He kindly explained to us the principle upon\\nwhich the seminary was conducted, and then offered to show us the house.\\nEvery thing was arranged with the greatest order and neatness. The\\ndining, school, and recitation rooms, were large, clean and airy, and\\nthe bed rooms commodious. Upon the ground floor was a chapel fitted up\\nwith the beautiful black walnut of their woods; here divine service is\\nperformed, by the Rev. Mr. Baldwin, to the school and people of the\\nneighborhood, who assemble{181} there every Sunday. You see the Illinois\\npeople are determined their people shall enjoy the blessings of\\neducation; and when we reflect how much the destiny of our nation\\ndepends upon the next generation, we cannot devote our time or our money\\nto a better purpose, than furthering such institutions. We left the\\nseminary, pleased with its arrangements, and wishing all success to the\\ngenerous individual who originated the establishment. It is delightful\\nto see wealth so well employed, to behold the ‘just steward’ thus ably\\ndisposing of his master’s property. Such disinterestedness shone out in\\nbold relief from the selfish and reckless waste of fortune which we had\\nbeheld in our pilgrimage, like one of his own ‘oak islands,’ upon a\\nsunny and treeless prairie.',\n"," 'Once more we experienced the pains of parting, and were forced to leave\\nour friends that afternoon. We returned to our hotel where we are\\nawaiting the arrival of our steamboat which is to take us to St. Louis.\\nWhen I look around in this interesting country, and upon such towns as\\nAlton, I wonder why our Atlantic cities are so full of people. How many\\nyoung men do I know there, and indeed, whole families, who are\\nstruggling for a living, and denying themselves every comfort that their\\nspare income may suffice, to give them a showy appearance in public;\\ncrammed into crowded boarding houses, narrow, hot, dusty streets, when\\nthere is here in this wide beautiful land, room, fresh air, fine\\nscenery, employment, everything to be enjoyed, at half the expense they\\nare forced to lay out among so many discomforts. The steamboat bell\\nwarns me to put up my note book, and I will resume when aboard.{182}',\n"," 'We found ourselves in a small steam-boat, which makes regular trips\\nbetween this town and St. Louis, twenty-five miles. Alton looked very\\npretty when we turned to bid a sorrowful adieu, and we regretted our\\ntime would not allow us to remain in this interesting place. We are now\\nall eagerly looking out, for the giant Missouri, whose junction with the\\nMississippi is but two miles below Alton. At length the point is in\\nview, all gather upon the guards, and bend our eyes towards the right\\nshore,—we are now before the mouth and behold an extraordinary scene.\\nThe Missouri does not, as travellers tell us, come rushing, and\\nbounding, and dashing along, striking the Mississippi with such a\\nconcussion that volumes of mist arise in the air,—we beheld nothing so\\nwonderful—a broad stream rolled down between its verdant banks,\\nrapidly, and very like a torrent, but in quite a decent and proper\\nmanner. Its color—alas, for our pellucid lakes—is a tint not often\\nrecognized by artists, but generally called gruel or soap-suds hue. It\\nholds in solution such an extraordinary quantity of clay, that one\\nwonders how the steamboat can force its way through it. Its rapid\\ncurrent is distinguished by the curls and little whirlpools among the\\nmud. Where it meets the Mississippi is a small ridge of clay, and thick\\nmasses push themselves under the clear brown water, coloring it more and\\nmore with its impurity, until at last, the unhappy Mississippi, after\\nstruggling for some time, is completely lost in the clayey stream, as\\nsome pure young heart, striving against temptation, but lost at last.\\nThe streams continue separate for some miles below St. Louis, and there\\nthe river takes the Missouri character. I looked up{183} the vista of this\\ngrand stream, as we passed its mouth, with sentiments of awe. A mighty\\nmass of water—it came rolling down nearly four thousand miles from its\\nsource in the wild recesses of the Rocky Mountains, bearing upon its\\nbosom, not a fleet of Argosies, but materials for their construction in\\nwhole forests of gigantic trees.',\n"," 'Such an admirer of water as you know I am, you may be sure I regretted\\nthe soiling of my bright brunette Mississippi. To watch the foam of our\\nvessel had been a favorite pastime, but alas, what a change from the\\ndiamond and emerald of our lakes, the topaz of the Illinois, the Zircon\\nof the Mississippi to the soapsuds of the Missouri. I have called the\\nMississippi coffee color; it is now coffee-au-lait, and indignant must\\nthe father of waters be under so great an oppression. Several green\\nislands adorn the stream, and the shores are spotted with a few houses,\\nand now chimney, and roof, and tower, piled up against each other,\\nproclaim a city, and we are soon in sight of the city of St. Louis. An\\nold castellated Spanish mansion is the first relic we have seen of that\\nbrave Castilian race which once reigned over these broad lands. It is, I\\nthink, their ultima thula, their most northern point. The appearance\\nof St. Louis, from the water, is very much like Albany, as it is built\\nupon rising ground, consisting of two plateaus of land, the last\\nelevated several feet above the other, but its water craft gave it quite\\na different character. We are used in our cities to behold the water\\nfront, bristling with masts, but here we saw steamboats alone, there\\nbeing about seventy moored at the wharves, which gave a novel and\\nwestern appearance, to the scene.{184} The flat boat, is fast disappearing,\\nand steamboats, are the only style of boat, with few exceptions, which\\nwe see; of these, five hundred and eighty-eight have been built upon the\\nwestern waters.[21] The city of St. Louis stretches a mile along the\\nelevated shore, and nearly the same distance back. We almost fancied\\nourselves in New York again, so great was the stir upon the wharf. The\\nware-houses, of brick or limestone, made of the rock upon which they\\nstand, appeared filled with goods and customers, boxes and bales, carts\\nand barrows were floating about, and every one seemed active except the\\nnegro slaves who were plodding about their work with the usual\\nnonchalant gait of this merry but indolent nation. We missed our good\\nwharves at home, and even the paved bank of Alton, for a shower had\\nrendered the shore muddy. Surely some Yankee might contrive a more\\ncommodious landing; something that might rise and fall with the river,\\nor a long pier. We drove to the Missouri House, where we arrived in time\\nfor tea, and at night were lulled to sleep by a Spanish guitar, and\\nchattering of French voices from the shops and cafes in our\\nneighborhood.{185}',\n"," '\\nSt. Louis, July 12.\\n',\n"," 'My dear E.—The days we have spent here, we have been very busy,\\nexcept Sunday, in examining every thing in and about this place. It is a\\nvery nice city, and one of much importance, has increased much lately,\\nand will continue to increase. Its population is twenty-four thousand\\nfive hundred and fifty-five. In 1825 it was only six thousand. There are\\nseveral good churches here, some of which, we attended to-day, it being\\nSunday. There is a pretty episcopal of the Gothic form, a baptist\\nchurch, of brick, having a neat white porch in front—an unitarian, of\\nplaster—a methodist, and a large cathedral belonging to the catholics.\\nThis is an odd picturesque building, and is one hundred and thirty-six\\nfeet by eighty-four broad, built of grey stone. You enter by a porch\\nsupported by four Doric columns. The body of the church is divided by\\ncolumns, lighted by elegant chandaliers; the sacristy and altar are very\\nhandsome; the windows of painted glass; and there is in the church a\\nfine{186} painting of St. Louis, presented by Louis XVIII. The bells are\\nfrom Normandy. We had penetrated two thousand miles in the wilderness of\\nthe west, and were glad to find we had not yet ‘travelled beyond the\\nSabbath.’',\n"," 'What nice resting spells these Sabbaths are! When whirled upon the\\nstream of life, our attention occupied in avoiding the snags and sawyers\\nand cross currents in our channel, how refreshing, how necessary is it\\nfor us to anchor for a little while, and look about, and consider our\\nfuture course. The Sabbath is a precious anchor to the soul, giving it\\ntime to meditate upon its future career, and consult those charts which\\na kind heaven has sent to direct its route. The Sabbath is necessary to\\nman, and was given in mercy. Physicians tell us rest is required for the\\nmachinery of man; that the brain and nerves, while forever upon the\\nstretch will decay much sooner than if sometimes relaxed. It was the\\nopinion of the great Wilberforce, that the suicide of Lord Londonderry\\nand that of Sir Samuel Romilly was owing to their neglect of this day of\\nrest. Speaking of the death of the former he says, ‘he was certainly\\nderanged—the effect probably of continued wear and tear of the mind.\\nBut the strong impression of my mind is, that it is the effect of the\\nnon-observance of the Sabbath, both as abstracting from politics, from\\nthe continual recurrence of the same reflections, and as correcting the\\nfalse views of worldly things, and bringing them down to their own\\nindistinctness. He really was the last man in the world who appeared\\nlikely to be carried away into the commission of such an act, so cool,\\nso self possessed! It is very curious{187} to hear the newspapers speaking\\nof incessant application to business, forgetting that by a weekly\\nadmission of a day of rest, which our Maker has graciously enjoined, our\\nfaculties would be preserved from the effects of this constant strain. I\\nam strongly impressed with the recollection of your endeavors to prevail\\nupon the lawyers to give up Sunday consultations in which poor Romilly\\nwould not concur. If he had suffered his mind to enjoy such occasional\\nrelaxations it is highly probable the strings would never have snapped,\\nas they did, from over extension.’',\n"," 'July 13th.—This morning we took a coach and drove about to every\\nthing worth seeing in the city. In the French part of the town, the\\nstreets are narrow and present quite a foreign and antique appearance.\\nHere are several neat, white-washed steep roofed dwellings surrounded by\\npiazzas, and occupied by the French part of the community. Main street,\\nwhich corresponds with our Pearl street, runs parallel with the river,\\nabout a mile. It appears a very busy street and here one may obtain\\ngoods from all quarters of the world brought up from New Orleans,—and\\ndomestic wares from the country around. As you ascend from the river the\\nstreets are wider and better built, and the upper end of the city is\\nlaid out in wide streets fast filling up with handsome buildings, public\\nand private, some of these last, surrounded by courts and adorned by\\ntrees. Here many eastern people dwell. A gentleman of the place, told us\\nthere had been nine hundred houses put up in the city this year, and\\nfrom appearances I should think this a true estimate. There is a medical\\ncollege in progress, and a large hotel{188} nearly finished, which is said\\nto be the largest hotel in the States. It is of red brick ornamented\\nwith white marble, and is altogether a handsome building. It is to be\\ncalled the ‘St. Louis House.’ Several institutions are conducted by\\ncatholics, as the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and the University of St.\\nLouis. In the library of the latter are nearly seven thousand volumes.\\nThe court house is of brick, with a circular portico supported by white\\ncolumns. It stands in a large court in the centre of the city surrounded\\nby an iron railing. We entered the hall, and ascending to the cupola,\\nbeheld a very delightful scene. The city is laid out as in a map below\\nus—behind stretch the verdant prairies, in front the swift rolling\\nMississippi, and beyond it, the rich fields of the American bottoms in\\nIllinois, and the white buildings of Illinois town opposite. While\\nleaving the court house we were attracted by some advertisements upon\\nthe door, for the sale of slaves. We noticed one for the sale of\\n‘Theresa, a likely negro girl about twelve years of age.’ This was our\\nfirst intimation we were in a land of slavery. You must not expect a\\ndissertation upon slavery, for whatever my opinions are I shall keep\\nthem to myself, as I cannot mend or alter the state of things by my\\nadvise, nor is it a woman’s province to meddle in such high matters of\\nState. However I might think, I certainly shall never speak in public\\nupon the subject, as I have a good old friend, called St. Paul, and he\\nin one of his letters says ‘It is a shame for a woman to speak in\\npublic,’ and ‘women should be keepers at home.’ It is true I am not a\\nkeeper at home just now, but I am travelling for health, and not to\\nenlighten the people with my wisdom. The num{189}ber of slaves in Missouri\\nis forty eight thousand nine hundred and forty-one—its entire\\npopulation is five hundred thousand. We visited a museum here,\\ncelebrated for its collection of organic remains, and we were surprised\\nat the number and good preservation of these ‘medals of creation.’ The\\nowner and keeper of this museum is Mr. Koch, a man of great enthusiasm\\nupon the subject of paleantology. He had just returned from an\\nexpedition to the interior of Missouri from whence he had procured\\nninety weight of bones. Seeing our interest in these things he admitted\\nus into an interior room which had the appearance of a charnel house,\\nfilled with bones and skeletons, which his servant was covering with\\npreparation to preserve them from the effects of the air. Among them\\nwere gigantic remains of the mastodon and other huge animals, with teeth\\nin excellent preservation. This museum contained many well preserved\\nspecimens, the most important of all was a huge animal with tusks, which\\nhe called missourium. He found also a head of an unknown animal which is\\ncertainly the largest quadruped whose remains have been discovered,\\nhaving two horns each ten feet long, extending out horizontally on each\\nside, making with the head, a length of twenty-five feet from the tip of\\none tusk to that of the other. The missourium, so called from the State\\nin which it was found, was an animal much larger than the elephant,\\nhaving tusks measuring four and a half feet in length, and one and a\\nhalf in circumference near the head. These animals, with the\\nantediluvial rein-deer, and horse of a large size, and myriads of broken\\nbones, were found by Mr. Koch last May, near the sulphur springs, at\\nLittle{190} Rock creek, twenty-two miles south of St. Louis. They were in a\\nvalley surrounded by high cliffs; this great deposit of bones forming an\\n‘osseous brescia, such as is found upon the east coast of the\\nMediterranean sea.’ ‘The lower strata upon whose surface these bones\\nwere deposited,’ says Mr. Koch in his written description which he gave\\nus, ‘consists of a bluish sand resembling that which is often found upon\\nthe bottom of the Mississippi.’ These bones were cemented in a layer of\\ngravel one and a half feet in thickness. The cement is calcareous, of a\\nyellow grey color, containing saltpeter. It combines the bones and\\ngravel together, so that it is with the greatest difficulty they can be\\nseparated; this layer is covered with a crust of chrystalization. The\\nnext strata is composed of small pieces of rock, and bones, broken, and\\nin some instances ground to powder; these rocks are limestone, some of\\nthem weighing several tons. The next strata is blue clay from two to\\nfour feet in thickness, containing few bones; this clay is covered with\\nbroken rocks again, above which is the soil covered with trees. The\\nwhole mass makes a hill, sloping down from the rocky bluff, of thirty or\\nforty feet, to the creek. Mr. Koch is of opinion these animals herded\\ntogether, and sought shelter under these cliffs during some great\\nconvulsion of nature, and here met their death by being crushed by\\ncrumbling rocks, and covered with debris. Here we saw also the remains\\nof that animal which I mentioned in one of my former letters as having\\nbeen killed by human hands. Beneath it had been built a fire of wood,\\nand around it were Indian axes, and large pieces of stone which had been\\nthrown at it{191} as if for the purpose of killing it. The animal had\\nevidently been mired and killed by the inhabitants. This is a discovery\\nof great importance, proving the mastodon, according to Indian\\ntradition, had lived since the deluge. He showed us the elephant fish,\\nor spoonbill, taken from a lake in Illinois, which was saturated with\\noil, although it had been cleaned and dried several years; also some\\nlive specimens of prairie animals—the wolverine, the prairie wolf, and\\nthe marmot or prairie dog, a small grey animal, famous for dwelling in\\nthe same nest with the prairie owl. You have heard of this prairie dog,\\nwhose villages extend over many acres in the prairies; they burrow under\\nthe ground, having, over the entrance to their hole, a small mound about\\ntwo feet high and eighteen inches wide. Charles Lucien Bonaparte says of\\nthem, ‘It is a very odd circumstance that this owl and dog should share\\nthe same habitation, but so it is; and they present an example of unity\\nwhich is quite pleasing.’ Another striking feature in the case of these\\nanimals is, they make the same cry, cheh, cheh, pronounced several\\ntimes in rapid succession.',\n"," 'In the afternoon we strolled out to the suburbs of the town to see the\\nIndian mounds, several of which are grouped together near the river\\nbank, in the environs of the city. One of them is enclosed within the\\ngrounds of General Ashley, an ornament as rare as it is beautiful. Upon\\nanother is built the city waterworks. Upon one, about twenty feet high,\\na truncated cone, covered with soft grass, we seated ourselves, enjoying\\nthe silence, and watching the Mississippi’s flood rolling below us,\\nwhile we mused upon the fate and fortunes of these ancient ‘mound\\nbuilders.’ The{192} thermometer had stood at ninety-six all day, and we were\\nglad to escape the heat and dust of the city. The sun had disappeared,\\nbut had left a soft amber radiance upon shore and river, and a purple\\nhaze upon the tops of the distant bluffs of Illinois. While gazing upon\\nthese monuments, and looking at the relics of a lost race which they\\ncontain, we try in vain to pierce the mists of time and answer the ‘who\\nwere they?’ which we ask ourselves. The vast valley between the\\nAlleghany mountains, and the Rocky or Chippewayan chain, is studded with\\nthese antique mounds, from three feet to two hundred feet in height.\\nThey are generally in the form of a parallelogram except in the\\nnorth-west where they take the shape of a cone, and by a late discovery,\\nin Wisconsin, they are seen taking the figure of men and animals. There\\nis a human effigy which is one hundred and twenty-five feet long; the\\nothers are rude resemblances to the buffalo, birds, alligator, etc.;\\nthese are all lying down upon the surface of the earth. Our Indian\\ntribes each take the name of an animal, as fox, beaver, buffalo, etc.,\\nwhich custom might have also prevailed with the effigy builders. There\\nare several grouped together here, around the one upon which we are\\nsitting, and several upon the Illinois shore opposite. These last\\nconsist of small ones surrounding a larger one, which has a\\ncircumference of six hundred yards at the base, and is ninety feet in\\nheight; half way down the side is a step, or platform, cut into the hill\\nabout fifteen feet wide. It is called Monk’s hill, from the circumstance\\nof its having been the residence of some monks of La Trappe, who, during\\nthe troubles of the revolution, fled to this country and built a house\\nupon this{193} mound. Here they kept a garden and supported themselves\\nselling its produce at St. Louis, and by repairing clocks and watches.\\nTheir penances were very severe. What an illustration of Shakspeare,\\n‘patience on a monument,’ were these old men while meditating upon a\\ntumulus in a howling wilderness. In vain we puzzle our brain as to the\\ncause of these structures, and ask are they erected for mausoleums,\\nwatch towers, or temples? Those which have been opened contain human\\nremains, ancient pottery, instruments of war, and are evidently places\\nof sepulchre. Some of them contain rude earthen vases which had been\\nfilled with food for the use of the deceased. In vases discovered in an\\nIndian sepulchre, near Steubenville, upon the Mingo Bottom, were bones\\nof turkies, oppossums, &c., which had been placed there, that their\\nfriends might not want food upon their journey to the land of spirits.\\nStone pipes are also found, cut out of their sacred red clay of St.\\nPeters, or steatite greenstone and limestone, some bearing resemblances\\nto eagle’s or other bird’s heads. Arrow heads of flint or quartz, are\\nalso found with the former article, with idols, silver and copper rings,\\nand rosaries. You have heard, I suppose, of the circle of mounds around\\nwhich is built the town of Circleville, upon the Scioto river, of Ohio.\\nHere was an ancient city, enclosed by a double wall of earth, with a\\nditch between the walls. The walls and ditch occupy nearly seventy feet,\\nwhich gives thirty feet as the base of each wall, and ten for the width\\nof the ditch. This circular town, or it may be fortification, was three\\nhundred and fifty yards across. A square fort is near this, the walls of\\nwhich were twenty feet wide, without{194} any ditch. The fort is three\\nhundred yards across, and is an exact square. The present town is laid\\nout on these ancient and venerable works; the court house, built in the\\nform of an octagon, stands in the centre of the circular fort, and\\noccupies the spot once covered by a large and beautiful mound, but which\\nwas levelled to make room for the building. This forms the nucleus,\\naround which runs a circular street, with a spacious common between\\nthe court house and street; on this street the principal taverns and\\nstores are erected, and most of the business done. Four other streets\\nrun out of the circle, like radii from a centre. On the south side of\\nthis circle stands a conical hill, crowned with an artificial mound; a\\nstreet has lately been opened across the mound, and in removing the\\nearth, many skeletons were found in good preservation. A cranium of one\\nof them was in my possession, and is a noble specimen of the race which\\nonce occupied these ancient walls. It has a high forehead, large and\\nbold features, with all the phrenological marks of daring and bravery.\\nPoor fellow, he died overwhelmed by numbers, as the fracture of the\\nright parietal bone by a battle-axe, and five large stone arrows\\nsticking in and about his bones still bear testimony.[22]',\n"," 'We must regret the destruction of these mounds, but in consideration of\\nthose which are allowed to remain undisturbed, and of the taste and\\nfancy displayed by the citizens of Circleville, in laying out their town\\namong them, we may forgive them. There is an ancient fortification near\\nthe junction of the{195} river Wisconsin with the Mississippi, in the angles\\nof which mounds are erected. Upon the plantation of Walter Irvin, Esq.,\\nabout ten miles from Natchez, and seven from the Mississippi, is another\\nvery singular group of fortifications and tumuli. If you desire my\\nopinion, I should decidedly say they were erected over the slain in\\nbattle. Sometimes they contain but one body, perhaps of some great\\nchieftain, whom the enemy’s archers have stricken; others are erected\\nover several bodies, laid in layers, who, as fast as they have fallen,\\nhave been laid upon the mound, the earth placed over them, to receive\\nanother layer, until the tumulus is finished. Where they are grouped\\ntogether, and where fortifications remain, the spot may have been the\\nfield of some great battle, whose slaughtered ranks required many mounds\\nto cover them. We know it was the custom of eastern nations to erect\\nmounds over the dead. The army of Alexander erected over the body of\\nDemeratus a monument of earth eight cubits high and of vast\\ncircumference. Semiramis raised a mound to the memory of Ninus. We read\\nof their erection by the Babylonians in their trenches, during sieges.\\nWho were the people that erected these tumuli is wrapped in mystery\\nwhich I shall not endeavor to penetrate, but refer you to Delafield’s\\nAntiquities of America, who seems to have discovered much in the Mexican\\nrecords, which throws light upon the subject. It is his opinion they\\nwere Sycthians who crossed to this country over Behring’s Straits, and\\nthese people were once the builders of the tower of Babel, and dwelt\\nupon the plains of Shinar. When dispersed by the confusion of tongues, a\\nportion of them wandered through Tar{196}tary to the ocean, and there\\ncrossed, and gradually passed down the North American continent, to\\nMexico and Peru. He deduces his evidence from, 1st. Philology—as\\nthree-fifths of the American dialects resemble the language of northern\\nAsia, two-fifths the Coptics, and others the Sycthian; which last he\\ntraces in the tribes of South American, and the others to the North\\nAmerican savages: 2nd, Anatomy, which proves ‘there is much resemblance\\nbetween the cranium of the race of the mounds and ancient Peru, with\\nthose of the modern Hindoos;’ mythology and hieroglyphics, architecture,\\nmanners and customs. The pyramids of Mexico, Peru, our country and the\\nSycthian nations, are the same, with little variation; some of earth,\\nand others of stone. Mr. Delafield gives a plan of a building used as a\\nreceptacle of the remains of the princess Tzapotee in Mexico, which much\\nresembles some of the ruins in Ohio. This is called Mignitlan, the place\\nof desolation. In the article upon manners and customs, he relates the\\ndiscovery of some shells of the pyrula perversa in a tumulus, which are\\nused in Asia at religious ceremonies, and only found upon the coasts of\\nIlindostan. He traces these nations from the plains of Shinar to\\nTartary, where are numerous mounds, some in groups as they are found\\nhere, all containing bodies, with idols and implements of war,\\nprovisions, &c. In his interesting book, he exhibits the celebrated\\nAztec map, upon which by hieroglyphical figures their course is traced\\nfrom Behring’s Straits to Mexico and Peru. Among other figures we see\\nthere a boat, rowed by a man, meaning crossing the water; a large tree,\\nindicating their arrival from the icy regions to a fertile land; a{197}\\nrushing river, telling of the Mississippi; and lastly, a Mexican plant,\\ndenotes their arrival in that land. Surrounding, and between these\\nfigures, are hieroglyphics signifying battles, towns built, sacrifices,\\ncouncils, feasts, &c., and the number of years that the tribe remained\\nin one place. He has sustained his hypothesis very ably, and yet we may\\nsay, with Schoolcraft, this is a race ‘whose origin, whose history and\\nwhose annihilation live only in conjecture.’ It is to be hoped the\\ncitizens of St. Louis are aware of the treasures enclosed within the\\ncity and will take measures for their preservation—the place would be\\ncapable of much ornament as a public garden. As our country becomes\\nsettled these interesting reliques will be destroyed if care be not\\ntaken to prevent it. Their number may give us an idea of the myriads who\\nonce roved over these plains, and we may say, while passing through the\\nregions of the west, we are travelling over a ‘buried world.’ Beside\\nthese races, the Spanish, French, English, and Americans have lived and\\ndied here.',\n"," 'The city of St. Louis which is now so filled with Americans that it is\\nrapidly assuming an American appearance, was once inhabited by French\\nalone. The founder M. Auguste Choteau was alive when La Fayette visited\\nhere, but very aged. When young, enterprising, and ardent, he led the\\nexpedition which in seventeen hundred and sixty four ascended the river\\nto found a city. He selected the site and with his own axe struck down\\nthe first tree; houses soon arose, and the limestone rocks around, as if\\nby magic, were transformed into ware houses. As the French influence in\\nthe country was lost, the town stood still{198} until the American emigrants\\nflowed in, and since then it has rapidly arisen to its present\\nflourishing state, doing a business of six millions of dollars annually.\\nSt Louis is the capitol of the far west, and must continue to increase.\\nIt is the central point of the great valley of the Mississippi which\\nextends two thousand five hundred miles in width from the Alleghany or\\nApalachian mountains to the Chipewayan; and three thousand miles in\\nlength. It is seated upon a noble river, by which it is only three days\\nvoyage to the Mexican gulf,—only eighteen miles from the mouth of the\\ngrand Missouri, thirty six from the great artery of Illinois and two\\nhundred from the Ohio, through whose waters it has access to every\\nportion of the States. Behind it is a noble region of land watered by\\nmagnificent rivers, abounding in metals, coal and stone quarries,\\ncovered by a rich soil, and blessed with a mild climate.',\n"," 'July 14th.—The morning being fine we were advised to take some of the\\nfashionable drives, and accordingly sat out for the Prairie House. The\\ncitizens could not choose a pleasanter place to enjoy fresh air and\\nverdure. As we left the city, we passed several handsome country seats,\\nand then found ourselves in the prairie, which is of the species of land\\ncalled ‘barren,’ covered with dwarf oak, crab apple, hazel bushes and\\nprairie plums. The road wound through copses, and tufts of shrubbery for\\nthree miles when we arrived at the Prairie House, which is a pretty\\nbuilding, surrounded by shade trees and gardens. After cooling ourselves\\nwith ice creams, we re-entered the carriage and drove three miles\\nfurther{199} to the Sulpher Springs. Leaving the coach at the door of a\\nlarge house, we descended a deep dell, shaded by weeping elms, immense\\noaks, and beeches, among which ran a brook ‘that to the sleepy woods all\\nnight singeth a quiet tune.’ The water was bright and sparkling, but\\nvery nauseous, and tasted to my companion like the Harrowgate waters.\\nThe walks around this stream are very pleasant, and must be quite\\nrefreshing to the tired and heated citizen. There is much company here\\nduring the summer. We took another road home, and passed through a fine\\nprairie the commencement of the celebrated Florisante prairie which\\nstretches from St Louis to the Missouri. Although trees were grouped\\nupon the plains, we passed several spots,',\n"," 'In returning we passed a load of fine looking coal, which, we were told,\\ncame from Manchester, a small town a few miles distant.',\n"," 'At two o’clock we went on board the steamboat Monsoon, in which we were\\nto go to Cincinnati. Every minute we expected to go, but hour after hour\\npassed away and still we did not move. To our questions the captain gave\\nseveral reasons for the delay which seemed very vexatious to him. We\\nendured the day, as hot as it was, by amusing ourselves with reading,\\nwriting, looking at the opposite shores, which we should have visited by\\nmeans of the steam ferry boats which were crossing continually to\\nIllinois town, had we not imagined we were soon to depart—and in\\nwatching the busy crowds upon the wharf, among whom was an old negro\\nbefore an auction{200} store attracting customers by ringing a bell instead\\nof using a red flag as with us—but when night came, and we were obliged\\nto pass it in our hot narrow berths, among mosquetoes which no net would\\nkeep off—listening to the noise and profane converse of the crew of the\\nboats around, and imbibing the perfume of a dock, we became very much\\nvexed and very impatient to be on our way.',\n"," 'July 15th. It was ten o’clock this morning before we started, and then\\ndiscovered it was the arrival of a large party of St Louis fashionables\\nwhich had kept us stationary, and who, instead of coming as expected,\\nchose to remain to attend a party that night.',\n"," 'We, who had been used to the punctuality of our eastern cities, where\\nthe captain stands, watch in hand, to give the signal for moving at the\\nappointed moment, were extremely annoyed at such proceedings; but before\\nwe grumble too much it may be as well to look upon the other side of the\\nquestion. The steamers upon these rivers make long voyages, and require\\nmuch freight, and passengers, to pay their expenses.',\n"," 'From St. Louis to Cincinnati is eight-hundred miles, for which we were\\nto pay twelve dollars each, and finding only a few passengers engaged,\\nthe captain waited for this party, hoping in the meanwhile, some of the\\nupper steam-boats would arrive, and bring him some more freight, or\\npassengers. The only thing we could reasonably complain of was his bad\\nfaith, if he had openly told us, the state of the case, we should have\\nquietly remained in our hotel, awaiting his summons; instead of placing\\nthe delay to the broken machinery, some hands missing, provisions{201} not\\narrived, &c., off at last amids the shouted adieu from the motley crew\\nof Negro, French, Spaniard, and Yankee, which lined the guards of the\\nlong range of steam-boats, lying along the front of the city. There are\\none hundred and sixty steam-boats plying between this city and other\\nports. The city and its spires now fades away; and we station ourselves,\\nin a favorable position for beholding this famous country. The Illinois\\nshore is low, covered with forest, and is the rich part of the State,\\nwhich was called by the Spaniards, American bottom, bottom land being\\nthe alluvion which is found upon the river shores between the water and\\nthe bluffs, and which is usually overflowed at high water. A feature\\npeculiar to the county is, the land nearest the river is highest owing\\nto the constant deposit, and when the water retires lakes are left along\\nthe low land, which gradually dry away. This bottom extends from the\\nKaskaskiah river to the mouth of the Missouri, two miles from Alton,\\neighty miles—and from one half to two miles in length to the bluffs\\nwhich bound it, containing two hundred and eighty-eight thousand square\\nacres. The soil is of inexhaustible fertility, averaging from twenty to\\ntwenty-five feet. Coal is abundant in this alluvion, and in the bluffs.\\nThis is carried to St. Louis in great quantities, over the railroad, to\\nIllinois town. The Missouri side rises into high limestone bluffs, upon\\nwhich is built near the city, Jefferson barracks, a fine quadrangular\\nbuilding, containing fifteen hundred United States troops, and a few\\nmiles farther Herculaneum, having at the edge of the cliff a high shot\\ntower. Near this tower is a bowlder of vermiculae limestone fifty feet\\nby three hundred. Through{202} a cleft in the rocks comes rushing down the\\nclear bright Maramec. It takes rise among hills covered with pine trees,\\nso valuable in this region. Its banks are rich with lead, iron and salt,\\nand has formerly been a favorite haunt of the Indian tribes from the\\nquantity of pottery, bones, and arrow heads found there. Behind these\\ncliffs commences the celebrated lead region, where such quantities are\\nexported. The mineral region of Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin, are\\nstated by Dr. Owen, the State geologists, to be capable of producing\\nmore of this article than the whole of Europe. Missouri sends some to\\nChina, and has exported this year, to that country, five hundred pigs of\\nlead, to be used for lining tea chests. The rocks appear broken up in\\nodd fantastic shapes, taking the name of devil’s tea table, backbone\\noven, grand tower, etc. This last in a tall solitary rock, about one\\nhundred feet high, covered by a tuft of cedars, its stratification as\\ndistinct as if it was a stone tower. The cornice rocks are a ledge which\\nruns along the top of the bluffs for nearly ten miles. These rocks are\\nsaid by geologists, to have been once the barrier of a large lake or\\ninland sea, over them poured another niagara, which, wearing through\\nthem, caused their jagged appearance. When it burst through, it carried\\nwith it and deposited that enormous mass of alluvion which extends an\\nhundred miles into the gulf of Mexico. The rock along this shore is\\nmostly a blue compact limestone, thought by Schoolcraft to be the muscle\\nkalck of the Germans; sometimes it occurs fœtid. Near the city of St.\\nLouis, in this limestone, were found the impressions of two human feet,\\nas if the person had stood upon it while soft. The impres{203}sions were\\nperfect, and were not sculptured in the rock. This slab was cut out and\\ntaken to New Harmony, upon the Wabash.',\n"," 'The scenery I am attempting to describe is very beautiful and varied.\\nThe broad river, about a mile wide carries us rapidly along from\\npromontory to point, crowned by a village, ever showing us new beauties.\\nThe high wall at our right hand is not a mere line of rocks, but\\nsupports the land which commences from their summits, as if the river\\nonce flowing at that height had gradually worn its way down. This,\\nhowever is not the case, the deep bed having been scooped out by\\ndiluvial torrents. An amateur of geology at Alton, has another theory,\\nand attributes the location and course of their rivers to fissures in\\nthe coal measures. One side of the fractured strata is raised and the\\nother depressed, so that perpendicular rocks do not appear upon both\\nsides of the rivers. Whether this be the cause of their direction I know\\nnot; but that the cliffs occur upon but one side of the stream, I\\nobserved upon the Illinois and Mississippi. St. Genevieve, which we\\npassed this afternoon, is one of those old French towns, which were\\nbuilt during the sway of France over these fertile regions. We stopped\\nat the landing where are a few houses, while the village is a short\\ndistance up the Gabouri creek, upon which it is built. We could see the\\nsteep slate roofed French houses, neatly white-washed; the court house\\nand catholic church, whose cross glittered in the afternoon sun. Beside\\nthe river is a fertile portion of land which was allowed to the town by\\nthe Spaniards as common land upon which was raised the produce for\\ntown consumption. The town once stood{204} here beside the Mississippi, but\\nas the bank began to crumble away they removed farther inland. About\\nthirty miles in the interior are the celebrated iron mountains, formed\\nof micaceous iron ore. The pilot knob is three hundred and one feet\\nhigh, with a base of a mile in circumference. The iron occurs here in\\nmasses of several tons weight. The other hill is three hundred and fifty\\nfeet high, both ores yielding eighty per cent. Near the town is a quarry\\nof fine white marble, and a deposit of dazzling white sand which is sent\\nto Pittsburgh and sold to the glass factories. This is one of the ports\\nfrom which the iron and lead is shipped.',\n"," 'Kaskaskia is another French town nearly opposite this place, but being\\nbuilt four miles up the Kaskaskia river, we could only see its landing.\\nIt was settled by La Salle in 1683, and was supported by the Indian fur\\ntrade, and afterwards by flour, exporting in 1746, eight hundred weight\\nto New Orleans. There is here a catholic nunnery. The Kaskaskia river is\\na fine stream which runs into the Mississippi, a short distance above\\nSt. Genevieve upon the Illinois shore. It is four hundred miles long,\\nbut navigable not quite a hundred, owing to obstructions which could,\\nwith small expense, be cleared away. Some of the best land in the State\\nis upon its banks.',\n"," 'Chester is a small town a few miles beyond it, seated at the foot of a\\nhigh range of cliffs. Although small in appearance it carries on a brisk\\ntrade, its exports by steamboat being, in 1836, one hundred and fifty\\nthousand dollars. Among other manufactories is one for making castor\\noil. Near this is fort Chartres, built by the French in 1720, to defend\\nthemselves{205} against the Spaniards. It was a fine specimen of the style\\nof Vaubon, and built in the most solid manner, but now lies in ruins,\\nhaving large trees growing upon its prostrate walls.',\n"," 'At the mouth of Big Muddy river, forty miles below Kaskaskia, we stopped\\nto take in wood, and we went on shore to take an evening stroll. The\\nFrench named this stream riviere au vase, from a vase of earthen ware\\ndiscovered upon its banks. There is much good coal upon its shores. We\\nwandered through the ‘the forest’s leafy labyrinth,’ wondering at the\\ngreat size, and luxuriant foliage of the trees. The locust here grows to\\nthe height of eighty or ninety feet; the beeches, oaks, and sycamores,\\nare enormous. The parsimon grows larger here than with us. We also\\nobserved the Chickasaw plum, the pawpaw, and cotton tree. We seated\\nourselves upon the bank of the river, and looked upon it with wonder as\\nit came rushing wildly past, much like a stream which has just plunged\\nover some high ledge of rocks. Upon its bosom it bears a forest of\\ntrees, some old and water-worn, shorn of their honors, and some torn\\naway in all the glory and beauty of their youth. The water comes with\\nsuch velocity that it tears away the earth from one side of the river\\ncarrying it to the other, thus constantly changing the shape of the\\nshores, and varies its channel so that the navigator is often puzzled to\\nfind his course.',\n"," 'I am glad I have looked upon the Mississippi. To read of it and to see\\nit are two different things. All these wondrous works of the Creator\\ngive us clearer ideas of his power and his goodness. It is indeed an\\nextraordinary sight—a river over three thousand miles{206} long, and from a\\nmile to one and a half miles wide, traversing eighteen degrees of\\nlatitude through various climates, from the arctic to the equator, over\\n‘more degrees of latitude than any other river in the world.’ Some\\nwriters call this river the Miss Sipi, ‘father of waters,’ while others\\ntell us its name is Namæsi Sipu, Tish river. It flows from Itasca lake,\\na transparent cool reservoir of water, fifteen hundred feet above the\\ngulf of Mexico, a clear beautiful stream; plunges over the falls of St.\\nAnthony, and then, a broad river one mile and a half wide, it sweeps in\\nlong regular bends through a wide valley adorned with varied scenery,\\nuntil it enters the gulf of Mexico. Sometimes it is lined with bluffs\\nfrom one hundred to four hundred feet high, or a soft green prairie,\\nsloping banks, impenetrable marshes, large cities, and pretty villages.\\nThe clay which the Missouri brings with it is heaped upon the shores, or\\nin a pile at the bottom of the river, upon which a snag, a long trunk of\\na tree is flung, which, standing upright, pierces the bottoms of\\nvessels; or as a sawyer, rises and falls, to strike the unfortunate bark\\nwhich happens to pass over it. The danger from these is, however, much\\ndiminished by the ingenuity of Captain Henry M. Shreve, who has\\ncontrived a machine worked by steam, by means of which, when the water\\nis low, he raises the snags and sawyers from the river. We were told he\\nthis year extracted fifteen hundred, besides tearing away from the banks\\nmany thousands which were ‘topling to a fall.’ It seems a hopeless task\\nto pull away the hanging trees from the wooded shores of a river three\\nthousand one hundred and sixty miles long, whose banks are constantly\\nunder{207}mined by the waters; besides the Ohio which runs twelve hundred\\nmiles; and when these are cleared the mad Missouri coming down over\\nthree thousand miles through a forest clad country, continually sends\\ndown fresh victims which it has wrenched from their homes, to consign in\\nall the ‘pride of life’ to destruction. As if not content with the\\nmischief, the Mississippi sometimes takes a fancy to make a cut off;\\ninstead of following the curve or bend which it has made into the\\ncountry for perhaps twenty miles, it dashes with fury against the earth\\nin front until it cuts its way through and reaches its former channel,\\ntearing away with it houses, lands, and whatever had stood in its path.\\nThis malicious conduct the Indians impute to its enmity to the white\\nman, and fills up its channel, plants snags and sawyers to vex and to\\nwreck him. The earthquake in the year 1811, the year in which Fulton\\nlaunched the first boat upon the western waters, they say was caused by\\ntheir Manitou, to frighten the white man away from his country. The\\nearthquake was felt in many places slightly, but at New Madrid, upon the\\nMississippi, it was very severe. Houses and chimneys were thrown down;\\nland raised for some distance down the river, and in many places it\\ncracked apart vomiting up fire and red hot sand. Lakes were formed of\\nmiles in length which still remain. The introduction of steam is fast\\nconquering all obstacles. Before its introduction three or four months\\nwere employed in voyages where now it is done in so many weeks. The\\nflat-boat floated upon the tide, or pushed along with poles; and when a\\npoint was to be cleared the crew landed, and fastening ropes to the\\ntrees drew their bark along; this process{208} was called cordelling.\\nThere are now upon these waters four hundred and thirty-seven\\nsteamboats, from thirty to seven hundred and eighty-five tons, besides\\nflat and keel boats, but no sloops or sail boats, except an occasional\\nsail put up by the keel boats. These boats are very different from those\\nused upon our eastern waters. Our cabins and saloon you know are upon\\nthe same deck with the machinery, and dining rooms below, while above is\\na fine long promenade deck. When you enter one of these boats you step\\nupon the lowest deck, having the machinery in the centre, while the ends\\nare covered with freight, or deck passengers who cannot pay the cabin\\nfare. Ascending a stair-way you find yourself upon the guards, a walk\\nextending all around the boat like a narrow piazza, from which several\\ndoors open into the rooms. The whole deck here is thrown into three\\napartments; the ladies cabin at the stern having state-rooms around it,\\nopening upon the deck or into the cabin; from this folding doors lead\\ninto the dining-room surrounded with gentlemen’s berths; beyond is the\\nbar-room, from which you pass into an open space where, around two smoke\\npipes, the male passengers assemble to smoke and chat. The ladies cabin\\nis handsomely furnished with every convenience, and in some instances\\nwith a piano. Above this is yet another deck called the hurricane deck.\\nThis is the best situation for viewing the scenery, were it not for the\\nsteam-pipe which, as these are high pressure boats, sends out the steam\\nwith a loud burst, like a person short of breath.',\n"," 'July 16th.—I arose with the dawn, to obtain a peep{209} at the junction\\nof the Ohio with the Mississippi. We turned from the wide Mississippi\\nand its turbid waters, into the glassy Ohio, around a point of land upon\\nwhich is built the town of Cairo. The land is low here, and subject to\\ninundations, but it is expected the art of man will overcome this, and\\nCairo, at the junction of these two great rivers, will become a large\\ncity. The central railroad is to commence here, which will cross\\nIllinois to Galena, from thence to the Mississippi river, a distance of\\nfour hundred and fifty-seven and a half miles. There are several other\\ntowns upon, and near this point, as America, Unity, Trinity, and Fulton,\\nwhere a statue to the great steamboat projector will be erected. A\\nlittle farther on is another village, called Caledonia.',\n"," 'Our passengers consist of a party of fashionables, on a jaunt of\\npleasure to the Sulphur Springs, of Virginia; some travelling merchants,\\nand several persons visiting the towns upon the river. A state room was\\nobserved to be constantly closed, and a young man about twenty, who\\noccasionally came from it, squeezed himself in, as if afraid his\\ncompanion would be seen from without. The curiosity of the young ladies\\nwas soon excited, and by means of the chambermaid they ascertained it\\nwas the young man’s wife, a young girl, apparently about fourteen, who\\nwas thus carefully secluded. A run-away match was immediately whispered\\nabout; the young people became quite in a fever to obtain a glimpse of\\nthe fair heroine. It was a long time ere their wish was gratified, as\\nshe never left her room, taking even her meals there. Our mornings on\\nboard are generally very social, the ladies sitting with the gentlemen\\nof their party upon the guards, or gath{210}ering in groups with their work,\\nwhile the male passengers are smoking, talking politics, or gambling.\\nThe negro banjo, and merry laugh, or joke, of some son of Erin, echoes\\nup from the lower deck; but in the afternoon the siesta is the fashion,\\nand every one turns in his berth to take a nap. I did not follow this\\ncustom, as I was unwilling to lose any of the scenery, so that I usually\\nstole out of my state room, like a mouse from its hole, and after a long\\nlook up and down the river, stole in again, the heat being too great to\\nallow of a long stay. Yesterday afternoon, oppressed with thirst and\\nwith heat, for the thermometer on board stood at ninety-six, I went into\\nthe ladies’ cabin in search of water, a jar of which filled with lumps\\nof ice, was placed upon a marble table in one corner of the cabin. The\\nladies were all in their berths except two, who were using every ‘means\\nand appliance,’ to keep themselves cool. They were each in a rocking\\nchair kept in motion, their feet upon an ottoman, made a table for their\\nbooks, while a large feather fan in one hand, and a lump of ice in\\nanother, were tolerable arms against the fire king. Miss Martineau\\nexpatiates upon the indifference of our females to the scenery of\\nnature, and I dare say, she would place these two upon her list of nil\\nadmirari ladies, but travellers are very apt to look upon the surface of\\nthings; these ladies, and indeed almost all we meet in steamboats, have\\nbeen so often over the scene, that they know it by heart, and need not\\nbrave heat and storms to see it, as a stranger would. Our people are a\\nrestless body, and men, women and children are always upon the move. As\\nthirsty as I was, I hesitated to drink the thick muddy water, for while{211}\\nstanding in our tumblers, a sediment is precipitated of half an inch. Oh\\nhow I longed for a draught of cool spring water, or a lump of Rockland\\nlake ice! While drinking, one of the ladies advanced for the same\\npurpose. ‘Dear me! what insipid water!’ she said, ‘it has been standing\\ntoo long. I like it right thick.’ I looked at her in surprise. ‘Do you\\nprefer it muddy, to clear?’ I asked. ‘Certainly I do,’ she replied, ‘I\\nlike the sweet clayey taste, and when it settles it is insipid. Here\\nJuno!’ calling to the black chambermaid who was busy ironing, ‘get me\\nsome water fresh out of the river, with the true Mississippi relish.’\\nEvery one’s back is indeed fitted to his burden. This person had lived\\nupon the banks of the Mississippi, had drank its waters all her days,\\nand now it required to be muddy ere it was palateable. The chambermaid\\ndescended to the lower deck, where a gallant black beau drew a bucket\\nfrom the river, and after satisfying the lady, she resumed her ironing.\\nAgainst this practice of ironing in the ladies cabin I must uplift my\\nvoice. I suffered from this annoyance upon the Illinois, Mississippi and\\nOhio. Constantly there was a woman washing upon the lower deck, where\\nthe water thrown from the wheel, falls upon the deck in a pretty\\ncascade, and another is ironing above. All the ironing of the boat, and\\ncrew, and often of the passengers, is done in the ladies small sitting\\nroom, the steam and perfume of the wet clothes, charcoal furnace and of\\nthe ironer is extremely disagreeable. In one instance I knew this to be\\nthe case all night, the girls taking it by turns; and I never travelled\\none day without this addition to the heat and other discomforts of a\\nsteamboat. In such long voyages it{212} may be necessary to wash for the\\ncaptain and crew, but surely bed and table linen enough might be\\nprovided to reach Cincinnati, where they stop long enough to have them\\nwashed. If not, why may there not be a room in some other part of the\\ndeck. The captain in some instances reaps the profits, as the\\nchambermaids are his by hire or purchase, and if they charge all as they\\ndid us, one dollar and fifty cents a dozen, the profit must be\\nconsiderable. It is sometimes, as in our case, a great convenience to\\ntravellers, but another place should be provided. But to go on with my\\nafternoon adventures. I left the cabin and walked out upon the shady\\nside of the guards. All was still except the booming steampipe; every\\none was asleep or reading. I leaned over the railing and found the banjo\\nplayer and his audience all in slumbering attitudes, or swinging in\\ntheir hammocks, and every thing denoted silence and repose. Suddenly a\\nterrific and astounding bang, clang and clatter, as if the boat had been\\ncracked to atoms, the wheel house was broken in pieces, the boards flew\\nover me, and a torrent of water flowing from it nearly washed me from\\nthe deck. In a moment every one tumbled out and rushed upon the deck\\nexclaiming, ‘what’s the matter?’ ‘are we snagged’—‘has the boiler\\nburst’—‘is it a sawyer.’ The old Kentucky lady who had stepped out\\nfirst, took her pipe from her mouth and said quietly, ‘It’s only a log;’\\n‘Oh, only a log;’ ‘nothing but a log,’ echoed from every mouth, and\\nreturning to their cabins they all stepped into their berths again. I\\nlooked around me in amazement. ‘Only a log!’ said I to myself and what\\nis a log. The steamboat is broken and stops, all is confusion and crash,\\nand I am told it is noth{213}ing but a log. ‘Madam,’ said I, turning to the\\nKentucky woman, ‘will you have the goodness to tell me what a log is.’\\n‘There they are,’ she said, pointing with her pipe to the river.\\nFloating along like so many alligators, were long branchless trunks,\\nwhich had been wafted along thousands of miles from the Rocky Mountains\\nperhaps. ‘But, pardon me madam, how are these logs able to create such a\\ndisturbance?’ ‘You seem a stranger child,’ she replied; ‘as these are\\nfloating along, and we are riding among them, what more natural than\\nthat they should get in the water wheel, break it, and stop the boat.\\nBut see, the carpenters are already at work, and I dare say they will\\nhave it repaired in the course of two or three hours.’ So saying she\\nknocked the ashes out of her pipe, took off her cap, and passed into her\\nstate room, to sleep away the hours we were doomed to pass under a July\\nsouthern sun inactive. The most remarkable event connected with this\\naccident, was the discovery of the fair unknown of the closed\\nstate-room. When the noise was first heard, the young man rushed out,\\nbearing a plump rosy young girl in his arms who, as soon as he put her\\ndown, began to tell the beads of a long rosary which hung from her neck.\\nOne glance sufficed to tell him the nature of the accident, and he left\\nher to walk towards the wheel house just as the Kentucky lady\\ndisappeared. Seeing the poor thing’s agitation, I turned towards her and\\nendeavored to sooth her. ‘I thank the Virgin Mary it is no worse,’ she\\nsaid kissing her cross, ‘but something dreadful will come to punish my\\nwickedness. Oh how could I leave my dear mother Abbess and the sisters!’\\nStopping sud{214}denly she gazed around her in affright, for she had\\nunconsciously said more than she intended. ‘Oh dear, what am I saying!’\\nshe exclaimed ‘where is Edward, why did he leave me!’ I soon succeeded\\nin soothing her, and when I related my conversation with the old woman,\\nshe laughed merrily at my ignorance. Her young husband returned, and was\\nso delighted to see her cheerful, that he immediately drew chairs, we\\nall sat down and were soon as social as old friends. I was much amused\\nwith the surprise of my companion who had come in search of me, when he\\nsaw me upon such familiar terms with this mysterious couple. The little\\ncreature seemed delighted to escape from her confined quarters, and\\nrelished a little chat so much that she this morning came to my room,\\nand sat some time with me. We passed this morning several islands, one\\nof them containing ten thousand acres, which, with the rocky shores of\\nIllinois, make the scenery very pleasing. Paducah, upon the Kentucky\\nside at the mouth of the Tennessee, is a small town seemingly solidly\\nbuilt of brick, but chiefly interesting from the romantic story attached\\nto it. It takes its name from an Indian heroine, who was here sacrificed\\nin revenge by a party of Pawnees. Fort Massac is a few miles below it\\nwhich was taken from the French by an Indian stratagem. The Indians\\ndressed in bear skins, made their appearance in the vicinity of the\\nfort, which enticed the Frenchmen out for a chase, when another band\\nrushed into the fort and took it. All were massacred. From thence to the\\nmouth of the Cumberland river the shores seem uncultivated, as the\\nsettlements are back from the river, but we were compensated by a\\nglorious show of{215} trees, vines and foliage of every hue. The sycamore\\nhere grows to enormous height, sixty or seventy feet, full of branches;\\nthese great branches stretch up eighty feet higher and spread out all\\naround it. The white of its trunk and limbs has a very pretty effect\\namong the green forests. The white maple is also a beautiful ornament to\\nthe groves, its leaves being a bright green, but every breeze stirring\\namong them displays the brilliant white lining. Its trunk is silvery\\nhue.',\n"," 'Upon the Kentucky side of the river we have the pretty yellow locust,\\nthe hackberry with its dark foliage, the mulberry, juneberry, with its\\nred fruit, and leaves lined with silvery down, and above all the tall\\nand graceful cotton wood tree, popular angulati, whose bright green\\nfoliage is very beautiful in contrast. The groves of this tree are very\\nornamental to a landscape. Among these trees upon both shores, we\\nobserved the brilliant bignonia radicans or Virginia creeper, which\\nmounted to the tops of the highest trees, and swinging down, arranged\\nitself in graceful festoons, adorned with its pretty scarlet, trumpet\\nshaped flowers. The river is more placid than our last, but is not yet\\nfree from the defilement of the Mississippi, and takes a yellowish\\ntinge. Golconda we passed about twelve o’clock, upon the Illinois side,\\na small town, remarkable for nothing but its fiery red brick court\\nhouse, with a cupola. There is a small settlement at the mouth of the\\nCumberland river, before which was a row of steamboats, which were in\\nwaiting for the rise of the river, to ascend to Nashville, in Kentucky,\\nwhich lies upon this river. Illinois, as if wishing to leave a good\\nimpression upon us at parting, rises in masses of limestone, presenting\\nevery{216} variety of scene, overhanging cliffs, promontory, walls, and\\ncastellated appearances, being the foundation of the State, for at the\\nsummit the ground continues in a plain to the lakes. Sometimes our\\ncourse lay so near these rocks, that we could distinguish the flowers\\nspring from the crevices, and the chrystal rills which jumped from rock\\nto rock. This destroyed the illusion of towers and turrets, but we were\\ncompensated by being able to examine the limestone which presented\\nvarious shades from the yellow clay marl to the compact and blue\\nlimestone and light solite. A large cave runs under these rocks, the\\nmouth of which is surrounded by a grove of graceful cypresses, which\\ntree we have observed occasionally upon the shore, before and after\\nthis. The mouth of the cave is an arch about thirty feet high. This cave\\nhas in the time of the flat boats been a sort of tavern, where the crew\\nand passengers have waited sometimes for days, in a storm. It was once\\nalso a robbers’ haunt. Many persons, anxious to descend to posterity,\\nhave cut their names upon the rock, and taken from the wildness and\\nseclusion of the scene by large black letters, but I shall not minister\\nto their ambition by writing their names. Shawnee town, is a place of\\nconsiderable importance in the southern part of Illinois. It stands upon\\na plain, elevated from the river, with a back ground of bluffs, and\\nseems a considerable place. The situation is most beautiful, and it\\nmakes a pretty picture from the river. A band of Indians of the Shawnee\\ntribe once lived upon this spot, but at the approach of the white men\\nretired to the western plains beyond the Mississippi. At Shawnee town,\\ncommences the great saliferous formation which ex{217}tends through the\\nvalley of the Ohio, to its head waters, and spreads away upon each side\\nthrough Ohio and Kentucky, and along the Alleghany mountains. The strata\\nof this formation consists of sandstone, limestone, coal, argillaceous\\nrocks, and slate stones, but the peculiar rock from which the salt water\\nis drawn, is a white calcareous sand rock full of cells and vacant\\nplaces, once containing salt. There is also an upper layer of white sand\\nrock, from which a small quantity is produced.[23] To procure this, the\\nboring is sometimes carried very deep, several hundred feet, as the\\nstrata generally lie below tide water, in this valley, and some wells\\nare sunk three hundred feet below the present surface of the ocean.\\nWhere they strike the flint rock strata it is very tedious, the workmen\\nnot being able to bore more than two or three inches in twenty-four\\nhours. Carburetted Hydrogen gas rises in almost every place where the\\nsalt is found, and wells are often sunk from this evidence alone.\\nSometimes the gas comes up with such violence as to drive out the boring\\nmachine, or flows with the water, and again, rushes up in sudden\\nexplosions, at intervals of hours or days, springing up in the air to a\\nheight of a hundred feet. This gas easily takes fire. Petroleom, is also\\nfound accompanying the salt, and is used by the inhabitants for bruises,\\nor to oil machinery. Filtered through charcoal, it is burned in lamps.\\nIn the country upon the Muskingum river are several deposites of salt\\nrock, or Muriatiferous rock. In Hockhocking valley, salt is reached by\\nboring to the depth of five hundred and fifty feet, and{218} at another\\nplace eight hundred feet. Here the water is very pure and strong,\\naveraging fifteen per cent of muriate of soda, and runs in a constant\\nstream of twelve thousand gallons in twenty-four hours. Salt is also\\nfound in the Monongahela valley. Upon the Kiskiminitas river, five\\nhundred thousand bushels are exported annually; it is found upon the\\nGuyandot, and in the northeastern parts of Kentucky, but the most\\nextensive salines are upon the Kenawa river where the strata occupy an\\nextent of twelve or fourteen miles upon the river. Fifty gallons of\\nwater, yield fifty pounds of salt of fine quality. In some places coarse\\nsalt, and in others fine table salt is made. This necessary article was\\nfirst discovered by the animals who seem to be very fond of it. The\\nmastodon, elk, buffalo, and other animals were in the habit of resorting\\nfor it to certain places which retain the name of Lick, as Buffalo Lick,\\nBig Bone Lick, etc. At the lick upon the Kenawha, the paths worn by\\nthese animals are still visible. For many years salt was brought to the\\nwestern valley with great labor over the Alleghany mountains, upon the\\nbacks of horses, and sold for two or three dollars a pound. Now it can\\nbe procured at the salines for half a cent. Around the salines are\\nfragments of broken pottery and other Indian articles, showing the\\naborigines were in the habit of digging for it. Upon Salt creek, near\\nShawneetown, is a very ancient salt work, which was once resorted to by\\nthe Indians. Vessels of earthen-ware bearing the impression of a basket\\nare found there, and one which was evidently used for evaporation is\\nlarge enough to contain sixteen gallons. This great deposite of salt\\nseems to be inexhaustible; for twenty-four{219} years it has been\\nmanufactured at Kenawha, and in these last years one million of bushels\\na year, and the supply has not diminished. Two hundred bushels are made\\na day. The process used is to convert the water by heat to brine, and\\nafterwards evaporized.',\n"," 'Ten miles below Shawneetown we pass the mouth of the Wabash, the\\nboundary line between Illinois and Indiana, a beautiful stream running\\nsix hundred miles through Indiana. Upon the shores of the Ohio near it\\nare groves of the Pecaun tree, carya olivæfornis. It is a beautiful\\nstraight tree, bearing a very pleasant nut. Pecaun, according to\\nSchoolcraft, is the Chippeway word for nut. At sun down we stopped to\\ntake in wood and to procure milk. As it was rather damp I did not land,\\nbut was much amused with the antics of men and boys, who delighted to\\nhave space, frolicked and jumped about the woods. The southerners in\\ntheir thin pink and purple or blue striped coats, added to the gaiety of\\nthe scene. Our steward with his tin kettle entered a small cottage, or\\nrather log cabin, near, and procured a supply of fresh milk, which we\\nsaw a young country lass draw from their cow she had just driven home.\\nWhile our husbands strolled together, my little catholic confided to me\\nher history, after the fashion of travelling heroines you know. She was\\nthe daughter of a wealthy planter in Kentucky, who, although of the\\npresbyterian faith, had sent his child to a catholic nunnery to be\\neducated. She had, as is very common in such cases, become a convert to\\nthe catholic faith, and when her parents came to carry her home,\\ndeclared it her intention to take the veil and never leave her convent.\\nHer parents intreaties and despair were of no use; stay she{220} would, and\\ndid. A convent, however, was not to be her destiny, for she fell in love\\nwith a young gentleman, brother of a friend of her’s at the same\\nconvent, who often came there to see his sister. The attachment being\\nmutual, they had, with the assistance of the sister, contrived to elope.\\nThey were now on their way to New York, and she was so fearful of being\\nrecognized and brought back, that she would not at first leave her\\nstate-room. ‘Were you not sorry to leave your mother?’ I asked her. ‘Oh\\ndear yes, she and the sisters were always so kind to me.’ ‘I mean your\\nmother and your father, not the mother abbess.’ ‘Alas! my parents are\\nsuch sad heretics that I ought not to love them. I shall never see them\\nin the next world, and it is better to be separated here.’ I was shocked\\nat her answer, but thought the parents were well punished for the\\nculpable step they had taken in placing their child where she was likely\\nto embrace a religion different from their own. I wish to say nothing\\nagainst the catholic religion, but if parents are unwilling their\\nchildren should imbibe its tenets, they certainly do wrong to place them\\nwhere they are taught. It is a custom too common in the west and south,\\nand this is not the first instance I have known of division between\\nparents and children in consequence.',\n"," 'July 17th.—We are now sailing along the coast of Indiana, having bid\\nadieu to the beautiful State of Illinois, after having travelled through\\nit and along its coast over eight hundred miles. This State seems to be\\nendowed by nature with every requisite for the comfort or enjoyment of\\nlife. It is three hundred and{221} eighty miles long and two hundred and\\ntwenty broad. Upon three sides it is bounded by the Mississippi, Ohio,\\nand Wabash, and upon the fourth by the great lakes; it is crossed by\\nstreams, canals, and roads, and thus is enabled to send its produce in\\nany direction. The soil which covers it is of inexhaustible fertility,\\ncapable of producing the richest fruits, grains, and vegetables, covered\\nwith woodland and prairie, and abounding with coal, metals, and\\nquarries. It presents a level plain, inclining gently to the\\nMississippi, consisting of thirty-seven million nine hundred and\\nfifty-two thousand acres.[24] The prairie land occupies two thirds of\\nthe State; the rest is wooded or bottom land. These prairies were once\\ncovered with herds of buffalo, wolves, and panthers; all now, except a\\nfew wolves, are far away over the Mississippi. These grassy pastures are\\nvaluable for cattle, and the soil is easily tilled, and produces trees\\nwhere the fire is kept off. All sorts of grain, neat cattle, swine,\\nhorses, tobacco, cotton, and sugar, are raised with ease. The amount of\\nthe productions of this State, according to the tabular statement drawn\\nup by the United States Marshall, H. Wilton, Esq., is fifty-one million\\nfour hundred and eleven thousand six hundred and six dollars. Take this\\naccount, and the number of its population, four hundred and twenty-three\\nthousand nine hundred and thirty-four, and then turn to the state of the\\ncountry only twenty years since, when it was the home of Indian tribes,\\nwith a few white men scattered over it, and you will obtain some idea of\\nthe sudden increase of the west.',\n"," 'The want of timber and water, as pine is scarce in{222} Illinois, and upon\\nthe prairie there is but little of any kind, has prevented the\\nsettlement of the prairies. It is the opinion of all whom I heard speak\\nupon the subject, they were the most eligible places of settlement, as\\nwater can be procured at the depth of fifteen or twenty feet, and timber\\neasily brought over the smooth plains in wagons, while cutting down\\nforests to clear the land is toilsome, and expensive. The centre of the\\nprairies is always higher than the skirts, which if it renders them dry,\\nmakes them more healthy places of residence than the dank, humid ground\\nof a forest. The tobacco, beef, and wheat of Illinois are superior to\\nthat of the neighboring States, and finds a ready sale in the market;\\nthe latter weighing sixty-eight pounds to a bushel.[25] Very good wine\\nis made there from the sweet grapes which abound in every part of the\\nState. Coal is found in abundance every where, and will be constantly\\ndiscovered; iron and copper occur in some places, while the lead mines\\nof this State, Wisconsin and Missouri, yield more than the whole of\\nEurope including England. It is generally a foliated glittering\\nsulphuret found in cubical crystals, yielding fifty per cent. in log\\nfurnaces, and sixteen more after further process. The masses occur in\\nclay and veins in the rocks. This rich mineral was so near the surface\\nthat the Indians frequently dug it up, and men in want of money were in\\nthe habit of procuring it, sure of a ready sale at St. Louis. The people\\nof Illinois obtained their nickname of suckers from the practice of\\ngoing up the Mississippi when the spring opened for lead, which was the\\nperiod of the annual voyage up the river of the Succar fish.{223}\\nThirty-three million lbs., was produced in all the lead region last\\nyear. The scenery of the mineral region is very beautiful and is watered\\nby the Mississippi, Wisconsin, and other rivers. The interests of\\nreligion and education are not neglected; the State has laid aside in\\nlands and money, three millions for the latter object. Colleges are\\nbeing erected, churches are building, and every thing for the comfort\\nand refinement of life is here in progress. So if you have a mind to\\nemigrate come to Illinois. We have to-day passed several villages upon\\neach side of the river, possessing little of interest to write you,\\nexcept Hoarsville upon the Kentucky shore, where we stopped a little\\nwhile. There is a coal mine in its vicinity. The Indiana shore presents\\nan elevated bank upon which we continually saw farms and cottages, but\\nthe opposite shore is low and subject to inundation, which gives it a\\nlonely appearance. Both sides however are adorned with beautiful trees.\\nHere beside giant beech, walnut and various oaks, were the pretty red\\nbud, cercis canadensis, the Ulmus Americana, red maple, sassafras,\\ncornus florida; upon the Kentucky bank, besides extensive groves of\\ncotton wood, were the basswood, or American lime with its yellow\\ntassels, the gum, American nettle with its red berries, June berry and\\nan endless variety of others, beautiful and rare. Fairy isles are\\noccasionally passed, covered with pretty shrubs and flowers and fringed\\nwith the soft bushy willow called here tow. Indiana shows many pretty\\nvillages, embowered among her trees, or scattered along her sloping\\nbanks, and we have to-day passed Troy, Evansville, Rockport, Rome,\\nFredonia, Manchport, while the other{224} side, Westport is quite a\\nconspicuous and pleasing town, situated upon a high bluff, its houses\\nperched like eagles nests, upon the high points of the cliff, while the\\nbrick court-house stands upon the bank beneath. The river upon both\\nsides had for many miles back, presented a succession of these bluffs,\\nwild and rugged, but after leaving Rockport, the rocks become more like\\nregular hills, rising gradually to a high summit, cone shaped, covered\\nwith lofty trees and a carpet of verdure. We here saw that singular\\nfeature of Ohio shore scenery, the hills upon one shore faced with a\\nlevel plain upon the opposite shore. Each shore presents a succession of\\nhill and valley, the hills on one side being opposed to the valley of\\nthe other. As if, while the river ran from east to west, the strata\\ncrossed it N. E. and S. W., a rupture in these would leave room for the\\nriver. This agrees with the theory of our Alton friend, that the\\nlocation and course of this river was caused by a rupture in the coal\\nmeasures. The boys upon the Ohio have imitated the Illinois ducks in\\ntheir pastime, of which I wrote you; when our boat has passed, they push\\noff the shore into the agitated water of our wake, and seem to take much\\npleasure in bobbing up and down. We sailed under cliffs this afternoon\\nof rough, rugged, jagged limestone, with precipices and romantic dells,\\nquite sufficient to satisfy a whole boarding school of romantic misses.\\nThe setting sun cast his shadows far over the river, leaving us in\\nshade, while far above the trees which fringed the cliffs were painted\\nwith gold. A ray piercing through a vista in the rocks, fell upon the\\nwindows of the pretty town of Evansville, tipping its spires with\\nburnished gold, lighting{225} up the windows, as if each house kept high\\nfestival. Tint after tint of all this glory has faded, and see, the\\nriver is white with mist now rising high above the trees. After the\\nintense heat of the day this strikes you with a chill, and they who know\\nits fatal effects hasten within—reluctantly I follow them and bid you\\ngood night.',\n"," 'July 18th.—We are now approaching the falls of the Ohio, which are\\nrapids caused by a ledge of blue limestone rocks, which here cross the\\nriver, and impede the navigation except in very high water. To avoid\\nthis, a canal is cut across the bend of the river, two and a half miles\\nin length to Louisville. This canal is excavated out of the compact\\nlimestone, and the cut is in some places ten feet deep. There are four\\nlocks. The amount of tolls received here from eighteen hundred and\\nthirty-one to eighteen hundred and thirty-seven, was, according to Judge\\nHall, four hundred and seventy-five thousand twenty-five dollars and\\nfourteen cents, and he gives a list of four hundred and seventeen\\nsteamboats which passed through the canal during the year eighteen\\nhundred and thirty seven.',\n"," 'There is a small place called Shipping Port, at the mouth of the canal,\\nwhere we observed several handsome carriages in waiting, for those who\\nthus preferred it, to the slower operation of ascending twenty-two feet\\nof lockage. Here were several steamboats moored. As we entered the\\nsecond lock, the North Star, a fine boat, of one hundred and forty-eight\\ntons came dashing into the lock we had left, and when we had both\\nascended, the Maine, which we had passed upon the{226} river yesterday,\\nentered the first lock, so that we had the novel spectacle of three\\nlarge steamboats, filled with merchandize and passengers, all at one\\ntime rising and falling in several locks. The locks are large enough for\\nfirst class boats, and the whole of the canal is finished in the most\\nsolid and beautiful manner. It is fifty feet wide at surface. No horses\\nare used, we passed through by steam. The strata cut through at the\\ncanal presented, 1st. friable slate three inches; five feet of fetid\\nlimestone, containing petrifactions, water lime, blue limestone, compact\\ngrey limestone, with nodules of quartz and limestone. The water lime was\\nused by the workmen. Cedar trees were dug up, human bones and fire\\nplaces. When we had left the canal, we beheld before us the sloping\\nbank, covered with houses, manufactories, churches, &c. This was\\nLouisville, the capital of Kentucky, seated upon a gradually rising\\nbank, commanding a fine view of the river and the Indiana shore\\nopposite. We landed, and as we had but two hours to remain here, we\\nimmediately entered a coach, and directed the man to drive us through\\nall the streets, past every remarkable building, and in fact show us all\\nthe lions. My head was out the window a dozen times, calling ‘Driver\\nwhat building is that?’ The streets are wide and straight, containing\\nmany handsome buildings. Main street is the principal business street,\\nand is lined with rows of shops upon each side, for, it seemed to me a\\nmile, and in the suburbs, iron and cotton factories, steam mills, &c.\\nThe private houses are handsome, and some of the new ones, built of the\\nnative limestone, threaten to rival any in the State. The hotels seemed\\ncalculated to accommodate a large number of{227} travellers. The court house\\nwhich is now building, is very large, and when finished will be quite an\\nornament to the city. It is an oolite limestone found in Indiana. We\\npassed a high school, seminary, twelve churches, a theatre, three\\nmarkets, and a large building with wings, having a portico in front,\\nsupported with marble columns, which is, we were told, the Marine\\nHospital. This city carries on a brisk trade. There are twenty-five\\nsteamboats, over a hundred tons burthen, which ply between this port and\\nCincinnati, and New Orleans. Louisville is five hundred and thirty-four\\nmiles from St. Louis, and we have one hundred and thirty-two more to go\\nto Cincinnati. If we are to believe one of their papers, the cause of\\neducation flourishes, as there has been published, this year, by one\\nfirm, one hundred and thirteen thousand volumes of school books, they\\nhaving in these and other works expended sixteen thousand dollars worth\\nof paper. Our driver stopped at the gate of a public garden, which he\\nsaid was a fashionable resort. We peeped in, but were more anxious to\\nbehold works of art than nature, and soon re-entered the carriage, and\\nfinding our time expired, returned to the vessel. Here we were obliged\\nto wait some time, and in the meanwhile amused ourselves, in examining\\nthe shore. Corn Island, with the rapids glittering in the morning sun,\\nwas upon one side, and upon the other, the town of Jeffersonville, is\\nsituated upon an elevated bank, on the Indiana shore. The buildings are\\nvery showy, being of red brick, and some of them pretty. Steam ferry\\nboats are constantly passing between this place and Louisville. Corn\\nIsland, is said by the Indians to have been the last stand of the last\\nof the mound build{228}ers, who, they say, were driven away from the country\\nby their ancestors. I forgot to mention New Albany, which we passed a\\nfew miles beyond Louisville. It is a considerable place, doing much\\nbusiness, and having several churches, lyceum, schools, and other public\\ninstitutions. The heat drove me into the ladies’ cabin, which being\\nempty, I sat down to put down a few notes. I had scarcely seated myself,\\nwhen the young catholic runaway, I mentioned before, rushed in, and\\nthrowing herself beside me, hid her head in my lap exclaiming, ‘Oh, they\\nare here, my mother, my father! they will separate me from Edward\\nforever!’ I looked towards the door with much anxiety, for I had heard\\nthe southern planters were a gouging, raw head and bloody bones sort of\\npeople, who whipped a slave to death once a week, and I feared for the\\nfate of the poor young wife. My information however, had been taken from\\nforeign tourists, and I found this idea like many others I had imbibed\\nfrom them, was far from truth. Imagine my surprise, when a pleasant,\\ngood humored looking man entered the room, and seating himself in a\\nchair, gave way to a hearty fit of laughter. His wife, a tall, slender,\\nlady-like looking personage, walked directly up to her daughter, and\\nfolded her in her arms, while gentle tears flowed over her cheeks. I\\nlooked at the father in perplexity, wondering at his extraordinary\\nmerriment, and at Edward who stood beside him, having, I thought, a most\\nunbecoming smirk upon his countenance. The lady looked up to her husband\\nreproachfully, but said nothing. ‘My dear madam,’ he said at last to me,\\n‘I understand you have taken a kind interest in my little girl’s\\nconcerns, and I owe it to you{229} to explain the circumstances of the case.\\nAnxious to give my daughter the best of education, I sent her to a\\nconvent not far from my estate, where there were some very accomplished\\nladies from Europe, who could teach her all I wished her to know. But\\nwhen I went to take her home, my lady fancied herself a catholic, and\\nrenounced her home and friends forever. I returned home in despair, and\\nwhile revolving my future proceedings in this disagreeable affair,\\nEdward, the son of a dear friend, who several years since had removed to\\nNew York came to make us a visit. In telling him my difficulties, I\\nadded how glad I should have been, had this not occurred, to give her\\nand my plantation to him. ‘I will scale the convent and carry her off,’\\nhe said, in a jest. The idea struck me as a good one, I pressed it upon\\nhim, and you see here they are, and have my hearty blessing.’ The bride,\\nas her father spoke, had gradually dried her tears, and raised her head\\na little. When she began to understand the denouement, she first blushed\\ndeeply with mortification, then pouted, and at last burst suddenly into\\na merry laugh, and ran like a fawn into her father’s outspread arms,\\nexclaiming, ‘Oh, you naughty papa! you good for nothing papa!’ The party\\nsoon after departed, and I received kind expressions and adieus from\\nall, and a few tears from the bride. All pressed us to visit them, and\\nthe father said if we would only come to Big Bloody Bone Buffalo Lick,\\nhe would show us the finest blue grass fields, best corn and tobacco,\\nand heartiest negroes in all old Kentuck. And if I wanted a nice young\\ngirl to wait upon me, I should have the pick of all his slaves. I was\\nquite delighted to meet with such a romantic adventure, for I had been\\nlooking out{230} for something, as you must be very tired of hearing about\\nnothing but trees, and rivers, and towns. Pray do not think I made this\\nout of my fertile brain, I assure you it is true.',\n"," 'After leaving Louisville the shores become more cultivated upon each\\nside than they have been. Extensive cornfields, in Indiana, show they\\nare as great ‘corn-crackers’ as their neighbors. The houses are better\\nbuilt, and always of brick or limestone, as pine is scarce upon the\\nOhio. The Kentucky river empties into the Ohio, about sixty miles above\\nLouisville; it is a beautiful stream coming down from the Cumberland\\nmountain, running through high limestone cliffs, and a rich country,\\ncontaining salt, coal, and iron, in abundance. It is three hundred and\\ntwenty-five miles long, and upon it stands Frankfort. At its mouth is a\\ntown called Port William, a small place. Kentucky shore, now becomes\\nmore cultivated and its blue grass fields nod in concert to the maize of\\nthe opposite side. Nothing could be prettier than the Ohio as we sailed\\nalong its ‘amber tide’ this day. The yellow marl, which occurs so\\nfrequently along its banks gives it a yellowish tinge. The river looked\\nas if it had been arranged by the hand of a landscape gardener, so\\nprettily combined was the grand and beautiful. The trees are so many of\\nthem cultivated with us in our ornamented grounds, that it takes from\\nthe wildness of the scene. Here we saw the locust, the horse-chestnut,\\nthe willow, tulip and column like cotton tree. Among these the Virginia\\ncreeper, grape, and other vines are clustering and swinging in the\\nsummer breeze. Springing from spray to spray was the mocking bird, blue\\nbird, and brilliant green and{231} red paroquet flashing in the mid-day sun.\\nAmong these are pretty towns, farms, and cottages—the whole having a\\nback ground of jagged precipice, or smooth swelling hills. Madison, upon\\nthe Indiana shore, is the place where we were to strike the Ohio, if we\\nhad journeyed through Indiana as we proposed at first. A railroad leads\\nfrom this town to Indianapolis, ninety-five miles, and is completed to\\nVernon, twenty-five miles. From Indianapolis to La Fayette is a\\nMcAdamized road, and another rail-road will soon be completed from the\\nlatter place to lake Michigan. That would have been our route, and we\\nshould have seen some of the best towns in Indiana. Madison is a very\\npretty town, and larger than any we had passed. It is built principally\\nof brick, and we counted six churches and a court house, besides banks,\\nfounderies, factories, mills and boat yards. The streets are wide and\\nMcAdamized. It is situated upon a sloping bank of the river, while\\nbehind it, the hills which rose up to nearly three hundred feet, were\\ncovered with farms, dotted with sheep and cottages. Some handsome\\nmansions were erected among the hills in conspicuous situations and must\\nhave commanded a fine view of the town beneath, and the river winding\\naway through bluffs and forests in front of them. The population is\\nabout two thousand. Madison is fifty-three miles from Louisville, and\\ntwenty miles farther is Vevay, settled by a party of emigrants from\\nSwitzerland. The river here stretches away to the north, leaving a point\\nwhich is the county of Switzerland, bathed upon two sides by the Ohio,\\nand containing very fertile soil. Here the transplanted Swiss have made\\na new home, and it is a very beauti{232}ful one, occupying themselves in\\nraising grapes. Their vineyards are very flourishing and they make much\\ngood wine. They cultivate the blue grape, Madiera grape, and the native\\ncounty grape, which makes good wine. The hills here, no doubt, often\\nresound with the songs of their father land from which they are so many\\nmiles distant. As we approach the State of Ohio we feel as if we were\\nreturning to a cultivated country, for farms and dwellings, of superior\\nstyle, denoting wealth and prosperity, occur frequently upon the shores.\\nOne of them was quite elegant, built of brick, faced with marble, and\\nadorned with a portico in front, of the same material. Our setting sun\\nis obscured by dark frowning clouds, which threaten us with a storm. It\\ncomes in whirling spray and wind which makes our stout bark rock under\\nus, and the terrific thunder out-roars our groaning steam-pipe. In the\\ncourse of half an hour it was over, but hundreds of lofty trees had been\\nswept from the banks and now were floating past us in all their leafy\\nhonors. A sudden stop in our boat’s speed sent us all out to ascertain\\nthe cause. I asked if it were another log, but found the engine had met\\nwith some breakage, which would detain us a little while. The steamboat\\nwas laid by the shore, and took this opportunity to get a supply of\\nwood. As the evening was mild we left the boat for a stroll, and to say\\nwe had been in Indiana. With some little effort we climbed the cliffs,\\nand when there, found ourselves in front of a neat farm house surrounded\\nby barns and orchards. The passengers spread themselves about in every\\ndirection, and we were very much provoked to see some of them wantonly\\npulling off the young green apples and throwing{233} them to the hogs for\\namusement. I do not know what kind of consciences these people had—I\\nwould as soon have stolen the farmer’s pigs as his apples; but I know\\nmen and boys are always rather lax in their morality towards apple\\norchards. Prompted by a Yankee curiosity to see the inside of an Indiana\\ncottage, I opened the gate, and after passing through a small court-yard\\nadorned with flowers, we entered the open door and found ourselves in a\\nneat apartment with comfortable carpets, chairs, etc. This room opened\\nagain upon a long piazza at the side of the house, ornamented with a row\\nof clean bright churns and milk pans. The farmer and his wife now\\nentered followed by a troop of children bearing pails loaded with\\nfoaming rich milk. They were surprised to find strangers in their house\\nand quite a crowd in front of it. Soon understanding the case, they\\nkindly invited us to be seated and offered us a choice of new milk or\\nhard cider. They had emigrated here from New York State soon after their\\nmarriage, and having hewed themselves a home in the forest, had\\ngradually, by industry and perseverance, brought every thing around them\\nto its present flourishing condition. They seemed happy and healthy.\\nFrom their door there was a lovely view of the winding river, and the\\nplains of Kentucky opposite. When we had descended to the shore we\\namused ourselves gathering specimens of the rocks. They were a hard dark\\nbrown limestone, and appeared a mass of organic remains, containing\\nencrini, terabratula, and orthoceratites. We searched the pebbles along\\nthe shore in hopes of finding some of the pretty silecious specimens\\nwhich I had found upon the Illinois, but succeeded, however, in picking\\nup{234} only some small pieces of jasper and a few petrified shells. At a\\nlittle distance a flat boat was drawn up to the shore and fastened to a\\ntree; one of those long odd looking species of water craft which once\\nwas the only kind seen upon these rivers. A man came from it, and as he\\nreached us, bade us politely good evening, and asked what we were\\nsearching for. Some persons would have found his conduct very improper,\\nand his question impertinent, but I never mistake the frank, kind,\\nindependent manner of my countrymen for impertinence. We returned his\\nsalute and informed him of the object of our search. ‘You’ll find\\nnothing here so pretty as is on the Mississippi and lake Superior. I’ve\\nbeen pretty much over them regions and found some rale beauties—they\\nare called cornelions, and red a’most as them what’s used as watch\\nseals. I found some geodes, I think they call ’em, also.’ I said I had\\nheard of those and hoped some might have been washed down upon these\\nshores. ‘My wife’s got some in the boat which she’ll show you ma’am if\\nyou walk there.’ I looked up at the boat from whose windows several\\nfemale heads were taking observations, and concluded to go there. We\\nfollowed our new acquaintance into his ark, which I found was his house\\nand shop, he being a floating pedlar, and had anchored, or rather tied\\nhis ark to the rocks here to avoid the storm. His boat was not the\\ncommon flat boat, but was of the species called keel boats, and\\noccasionally carried a sail. In addition to his sail he used oars and\\npoles to propel it with. It was a rudely built affair, just high enough\\nwithin for a man to stand, but every thing was comfortably arranged. His\\nwife and his other woman were setting the supper table. At{235} his request\\nshe readily displayed her stores, and would have pressed them upon me if\\nI would have taken them. After we had returned to our boat we looked\\ntowards the shore and beheld the crew assembled for a jumping match.\\nThey were a motly assemblage of fire-men, covered with soot, pilots,\\nstewards, etc. They formed a line—one of them placing himself in the\\ncentre, holding a stone in each hand, swayed himself backward and\\nforward, and then sprang, some jumping eighteen, twenty and twenty-two\\nfeet, with the greatest ease. While crew and passengers were thus\\namusing themselves, we were aroused by the cry of ‘The Ione is coming!\\naway boys, away!’ and bounding over the shore they were soon in the\\nboat. We understood the meaning of this sudden cry, and were much amused\\nwith the amazement and terror depicted in the countenances of those who\\ndid not. ‘What is coming?’ they cried. ‘Bears, wolves, sawyers, what!’\\nIt was soon all explained; the Ione was in view, which we had left\\nbehind us, and it was feared it would arrive at Cincinnati before us.\\nThe hands were working with all their might; the breakage was finished;\\nthe paddle threw up a whirl of foam; steam whizzed; pipes snorted;\\nengineer’s bell tingled, and away we went, hurry skurry, after our\\nrivals who had passed us with a triumphant cheer. Straining every rope\\nand piece of machinery we soon shot ahead of the presumptuous Ione,\\nringing our bell and shouting in our turn. She was determined not to be\\nout done, and a regular race came on. We ladies all determined we would\\nnot go to bed, but would remain up, alarmed and uncomfortable; one went\\nso far as to threaten to faint if the captain did not slacken his\\nspeed,{236} but we were laughed at by the gentlemen who enjoyed the sport.\\nHour after hour of the night passed away while we rushed swiftly through\\nthe waters, with our foe just in our rear. ‘Hurra! fling on more wood!’\\nwas the cry from below. High blazed the furious fire, illuminating the\\nwater around; the steam increased—the engine worked madly—the boat\\nstrained and groaned at every stroke, and seemed actually to spring out\\nof the water. Behind us came our rival puffing, panting, snorting,\\nthrowing out volumes of flame and sparks like some fiery dragon of old,\\nand as she came near, we could see into her lower deck, where around the\\nfierce fire, shadowy forms were rushing, bounding, carrying wood,\\nheaping it on, shouting and cursing. One strain too much—one upright\\nsnag in our path, and we should all be strewed, some hundred souls, upon\\nthe water, writhing, agonizing, dying—and all for what? that we might\\narrive one hour the sooner in the night, at Cincinnati, where we should\\nbe obliged to lie still till morning; or perhaps it was the honor of\\nbeating another boat,—honor here setting the steam in motion as well as\\nthe sword. Our rival, unable to compete with us, abandoned the race, and\\nwas soon left behind; our people satisfied with this wonderful triumph\\nrelaxed in their speed; the ladies recovered from their fears, and one\\nby one crept into their berths. We had here no such heroine as she who\\nis going the rounds in the newspapers, who in the excitement of the\\nrace, finding the wood failing, directed her smoked hams to be thrown on\\nthe fire.',\n"," 'Sixteen miles below Cincinnati is the residence of Gen. Harrison, the\\ncandidate for the Presidency. It is said he lived in a log cabin, but it\\nwas a neat country{237} dwelling, which, however, I dimly saw by moonlight.\\nTo judge from what we have seen upon the road, Gen. H. will carry all\\nthe votes of the west, for every one seemed enthusiastic in his favor.\\nLog cabins were erected in every town, and a small one of wickerwork\\nstood upon nearly all the steamboats. At the woodyards along the rivers,\\nit was very common to see a sign bearing the words, ‘Harrison wood’;\\n‘whig wood,’ or ‘Tippicanoe wood,’ he having gained a battle at a place\\nof that name. The western States indeed, owe him a debt of gratitude,\\nfor he may be said to be the cause, under Providence, of their\\nflourishing condition.

It is a fertile State, like its surrounding sister\\nStates, having but little hilly ground, most of it being undulating\\nprairie. It is crossed by several fine rivers; has the Ohio for its\\nsouthern, and lake Michigan for its northern border. It is two hundred\\nand seventy-five miles long and one hundred and forty-five broad,\\ncontaining thirty-eight thousand square miles. Except the sand hills of\\nlake Michigan, and swamps of the Kankakee, its soil is of inexhaustible\\nfertility. Canals to the aggregate length of two hundred and thirty\\nmiles have been completed, or are in a state of forwardness, and\\nninety-five of railroads. Indianapolis is the capitol, situated in\\nMarion county, upon the White river, and in the centre of the State.\\nThis county is a very fertile one, having raised the{238} last year,\\naccording to the marshal’s report, nine hundred thousand bushels of\\ncorn; sixty-seven thousand bushels of oats; thirty thousand bushels of\\nwheat, and twenty thousand head of hogs. Indianapolis is only twenty\\nyears old, having been, upon its site, a dense forest in 1820; now it\\nhas several public buildings, churches, schools, court-house, etc., and\\ntwo thousand inhabitants. The amount of tolls taken upon the canals and\\nrailroads of Indiana amount to twenty-eight thousand five hundred\\ndollars. Salt of a very fine kind is made in Fountain county. Its\\npopulation is six hundred and eighty-three thousand three hundred and\\nfourteen.

It well\\nmerits the name bestowed upon it here,—Queen of the west. We have\\nexplored it thoroughly by riding and walking, and pronounce it a\\nwonderful city. The hotel to which we were recommended, the Broadway\\nHouse, was commodious and well conducted. The family is a very agreeable\\none, and well educated, but remain in their own private apartments.\\nThere are numerous other hotels of all descriptions, but none rival it,\\nunless it may be the new one called the Henri House. Soon after\\nbreakfast we ordered a carriage, which we found to be quite as handsome\\nas any we have in our city. We spent the morning slowly driving up and\\ndown each street, along the Miami canal, and in the environs of the city\\nin every direction, and were quite astonished—not because we had never\\nseen larger and finer cities, but that this should have arisen in what{240}\\nwas so lately a wilderness. Its date, you know, is only thirty years\\nback. The rows of stores and ware-houses; the extensive and ornamented\\nprivate dwellings; the thirty churches, many of them very handsome, and\\nother public buildings, excited our surprise. Main street is the\\nprincipal business mart. While in the centre of this street, we mark it\\nfor a mile ascending the slope upon which the town is built, and in\\nfront it seems interminable, for the river being low, we do not observe\\nwe are looking across it to the street of the opposite city of\\nCovington, until a steamboat passing, tells us where the city ends.\\nBroadway is another main artery of this city; not, however, devoted to\\nbusiness, but bounded upon each side by rows of handsome dwellings.\\nThird, Fourth, Seventh, Vine, and many other streets, show private\\nhouses not surpassed by any city we had visited. They are generally\\nextensive, and surrounded by gardens, and almost concealed from view of\\nthe passers, by groves of shade trees and ornamental shrubbery. An\\naccidental opening among the trees shows you a glimpse of a piazza or\\npavillion, where, among groves and gardens, the air may be enjoyed by\\nthe children or ladies of the family.',\n"," 'We visited a museum in hopes of seeing some Indian relics or organic\\nremains, but found these curiosities had met with the fate of all things\\nin America, destruction by fire. The owner of the museum had been\\nnineteen years collecting it, and it contained, among other things,\\nbones of mastodon, and mummies, taken from a cave in Kentucky. The last,\\nwe were informed by the wife of the proprietor, were in a sitting\\nposture, wrapped in mantles, one having red hair,{241} the other black. She\\nwas now doing her best to collect another museum. Their house is a very\\nnice one, having three tiers of rooms, and is rented to them for one\\nthousand dollars. ‘How did the fire originate?’ I asked of the lady of\\nthe museum. ‘Why, ma’am,’ said she, ‘you must know the cellar of this\\nhouse, unbeknown to me, was let out to a yellow barber, who had some\\npowder for sale which blew up to our garret one day, and set it on fire.\\nI heard the explosion, but thought it one of the steamboats at the\\nwharf——’ ‘Pardon me madam,’ I said, ‘but pray how many times a week\\ndo your steamboats blow up?’ ‘Why, I can’t exactly tell——’ ‘Oh, well;\\ngo on with your story.’ ‘That day I came into this room before it was\\nburnt, and says, George, says I, to the man who is now playing on the\\norgan just as he was then, George, what is that which smells so much\\nlike burnt paint? Why, missus, says he, it is the back of this yere\\nbench which was almost a coal afore I put it out. Why, George, says I,\\nhow did that happen? Why, the yaller barber’s stove-pipe was so hot,\\nsays he, it sot it afire. I ran to the bench and found it had been, sure\\nenough, burnt, and the wall felt quite hot. George, what is that\\ncrackling noise, says I. Why it’s the yaller barber’s stove-pipe what’s\\na cooling, says he. But I smelt smoke, and I said to George, George, do\\nrun up stars and see if there aint any fire anyhow. He went, but soon\\ncame thumping down again, making as much noise as if he had been a great\\nmastydone. George, says I, what’s the matter? Matter! why, gorry, massa\\nmissus! the roof’s burnt and fell on the garret floor, and the garret\\n{242}floor’s afire and fell on the third story floor—— Pshaw, George,\\nyou’re poking fun at me; but just then up runs my husband as wild as a\\nprairie wolf. Wife! Good God! the roof is all afire! he cried and ran up\\nstairs; when, just as he reached the second flight, the third floor fell\\ndown upon him, and he was enveloped in flames. He was dug out, and you\\nmay be sure he was a show; burnt to a mummy; his hat looking a bit of\\ncoke; his dress hanging in scorched tatters, and blind with smoke, he\\nstaggered about like a drunken nigger. He was six weeks before he\\nrecovered from that burning.’ ‘Indeed; this fire has cost you much\\nsuffering.’ ‘I have not told you all. There is a young girl, a distant\\nrelation living with me, to whom I am much attached; she was up stairs,\\nheard a noise, saw the fire, and went to run down stairs, when behold\\nthe stairs was away—burnt and fell down. She ran about like a wild\\nInjun, trying to escape, but could not, and at last sank down at the\\nplace where the stairs had been, and expected to die. Just at that\\nmoment, as if sent by Providence, some men from a flat boat ran up to\\nhelp us. ‘Why, mother, you’re in a bad fix anyhow,’ said one; ‘what is\\nyour greatest treasure here, and we will try to save that first.’ My\\ngreatest treasure, I said, is a young girl, whom I dearly love, who is\\nup stairs; but I am afraid you cannot save her. He ran along and looked\\nup, when, just then, in a fit of despair, she flung herself down,\\nthinking she might as well die so, as she must die up stairs anyhow, and\\nhe being just under caught her. She was very much bruised, and her head\\nis still much affected with heat and wounds.’ I truly sympathized with\\nthe unfortunate dillitante, as the loss of a museum which one has been\\ncollecting{243} twenty years is a serious evil. I think it behooves the\\ncitizens of Cincinnati to encourage her endeavors to gather a new\\ncollection, by patronizing her museum. From the upper balcony is a very\\nbeautiful view of the opposite shores of Kentucky. The two towns of\\nCovington and Newport line the bank with numerous buildings, some of\\nthem very pretty; while behind them arise a range of picturesque hills,\\ncovered with luxuriant herbage. These two towns are separated by the\\nriver Licking, whose bright waters, after flowing for two hundred miles\\nthrough the fair plains of Kentucky, enter the Ohio opposite Cincinnati.\\nBeneath us we looked down upon the wharf, which was a scene of mixed\\ngaiety and business. A row of steamboats lay along the shore, from and\\nto which flowed a constant current of men and goods. From some of the\\nlargest, the music of the band which they always carry sounded merrily,\\nwhile broad, bright flags floated out upon the summer breeze.',\n"," 'Re-entering our carriage, we drove down to Fulton, a town about two\\nmiles from Cincinnati, but which may be called a part of it, as the road\\nis one long street leading to it, containing iron founderies, water\\nworks, lumber yards, &c. Omnibuses are constantly passing and re-passing\\nalong this street. We observed here several large steamboats upon the\\nstocks, some of which were copper bottomed, as a guard against snags.\\nFulton looks pretty at a distance, seated at the foot of a round, soft\\ngreen hill. After tea, we passed through the city, to the river, along\\nwhose bank, is a very pretty road. This is the fashionable evening\\ndrive, and we passed several carriages, containing ladies and children,\\nand young persons on horseback,{244} enjoying the bland evening air.\\nAlthough the heat had been excessive during the day; it was now\\nperfectly cool, which is usually the case here. Kentucky looked very\\nlovely, as the setting sun tinged its hill tops, and threw a rosy haze\\nover its groves, and fields and pretty cottages. The broad river looked\\nplacid and lustrous, as if rejoicing in the pretty reflections which lay\\nupon its surface. A small fort opposite, we were told was erected in\\nhonor of the hero of Tippicanoe, Gen. Harrison, who is much beloved\\nhere, and whom they expect to be the next President of the United\\nStates.',\n"," 'July 20th.—I am happy to inform you the state of religion and morals\\nin this place, are such as would please every lover of Jesus and of good\\norder. One fact speaks for itself, there are here thirty churches. There\\nare also twelve public schools, and between two and three thousand\\nscholars, who are there educated. What a blessed thing is it to see a\\ncity, instead of lavishing its surplus wealth upon theatres and places\\nof dissipation, erecting schools, and such respectable, nay, elegant\\nhouses of public worship as we see in Cincinnati. The consequences are\\nseen in the circumstances and behaviour of the people. Here is no haunt\\nof vice, no Faubourg St. Antoine, no five points, the people keep the\\nSabbath, and are respectable and happy. Sunday morning we attended\\nservice at Christ Church, where we heard the beautiful episcopal service\\nread by their pastor, the Rev. Mr. Brooks, who afterwards gave us a very\\ngood discourse. This is a very handsome church, in the gothic form,\\nabounding in spires and abutments, it is a grey brick edged with{245} stone.\\nThe interior is very elegant. The pews are all lined and cushioned with\\nblue, while the pulpit, and chancel, and reading desk, are a dazzling\\nmass of bronze, and crimson, and gold; they are of bronze and gilt\\nGothic open work, lined with crimson velvet. Some antique chairs, and\\nbenches of oak, carved, lined and cushioned with velvet, stand here,\\nwhile the whole is surrounded with a railing, and kneeling cushion of\\nthe same material and lining. The lamps and chandaliers are profuse and\\nrich, and the organ beautifully built of bronze. In the same street is\\nanother episcopal church called St. Pauls, which is in the Grecian\\nstyle, with a pediment in front, supported by columns. There are six\\npresbyterian churches here, some of which we visited, and which are\\nhandsome and well attended.',\n"," 'In the evening we went to the church of the Rev. Mr. Lynde, a baptist\\nclergyman, whose church is in a very flourishing condition, he having\\nbaptised five hundred new members last winter. This chapel is in Ninth\\nstreet, and is a large brick building having a tall white spire. Every\\nthing within is plain but neat. The seats are in the sofa style, edged\\nwith mahogany, lined and cushioned with horse hair, and having, several\\nof them, the owner’s name in brass plates upon the door, as in some of\\nour churches. The lamps and chandaliers, as in the episcopal church, are\\nmore in number and richer than I have ever seen in our best churches. We\\nwere quite pleased with Mr. L. His manner had a dignity and firmness, as\\nif thoroughly convinced of the truths he advanced; and his address to\\nhis people came with the power of one who spoke with authority. How\\npleasant it is to find this region,{246} which so lately resounded with\\nsavage merriment or war cries, now echoing the truth as it is in Jesus.',\n"," 'July 21st.—We arose early, and walked out to see the markets. There\\nare three, well built. The one on Broadway was filled with a profusion\\nof meats, fruits and vegetables, which last were uncommonly fine. The\\nstreets around the market, were blocked up with wagons loaded with\\ncountry produce. During our rambles through the streets I was struck by\\nthe sight of a building, the oddest I ever beheld. It was a huge ugly\\nthing, being a strange mixture of styles, and an attempt at Gothic,\\nTurkish, and Moorish. This was Mrs. Trollop’s erection, built for a\\nhouse of pleasure, and rooms were constructed for balls, refreshment,\\nand dressing rooms, while below were to be shops. These balls were to be\\nin the style of Almacks, quite exclusive. It is now a ‘Mechanic\\nInstitute,’ and when not using their rooms for the exhibitions, let them\\nout to lecturers, exhibition of pictures, or a fair. The front is of\\nbrick adorned with Gothic arches, and the roof surmounted with Gothic\\nornaments. A square tower rises from the back of the building having a\\nrow of brick pillars in front, this contains a room having windows all\\naround; on the top of this tower is another, a round one, having as I\\nsaid, a sort of moorish top. We saw the time approach for leaving the\\n‘Queen City,’ with regret. We left it in the steamboat Agnes, a new and\\npretty boat, but small, ‘calculated to run any where it was moist,’ as\\nthe river is too low for the larger boats to ascend to Wheeling. The\\nriver’s greatest rise here is sixty-three feet, and it then runs with a\\ncurrent of six miles an hour.{247} When out in the river we looked sadly\\nback at Cincinnati, which appears Queen like indeed, while majestically\\nreposing upon her throne of stately hills, with the glorious river at\\nher feet. Cincinnati is built upon two plains which rise in gentle\\nslopes from the river. Fifty years ago, fort Washington stood here, and\\nnow there is a large city of forty-five thousand inhabitants, containing\\nchurches, lyceums, colleges, and doing a business of six million\\ndollars. There are a great many manufactories, and forges, and the steel\\nand iron business is carried on to a considerable amount, ‘from\\nponderous beam of steam engine, cylenders and steam machinery, to\\nhousehold articles.’ Its doings in the pork line you have heard of,\\nseveral of the largest ware-houses were pointed out to us as ‘pork\\nware-houses.’ The Miami canal comes into the Ohio at Cincinnati, thus\\nbringing to it the produce from lake Erie. The little Miami railroad is\\nalso to terminate here. A bend in the river, and the ‘Queen of the West’\\nis lost to our eyes. The river scenery is very beautiful to day, lined\\nwith thriving farms, dotted with pretty villas and towns, having a back\\nground of those peculiar green hills which occur upon this river called\\nthe Ohio hills. Among the towns we passed were New Richmond, twenty-one\\nmiles from Cincinnati, Moscow, Mechanicsville, Augusta &c. &c. Maysville\\nis quite a large town in Kentucky which looked very gay as the sun,\\nsetting over the shadowy hills lighted up its scarlet brick houses and\\ngave a brighter tint to the cotton wood groves with which they were\\nsurrounded.',\n"," 'July 21st.—When we left our state-room we found{248} ourselves near\\nPortsmouth, the largest town we had seen since leaving Cincinnati. It is\\nseated upon a platform elevated above the river at the foot of a group\\nof pretty ‘Ohio hills.’ Every one looked very busy here, the shops\\ndisplayed a goodly show of merchandise, two large hotels seemed full of\\npeople, drays were travelling about, water carts were being filled in\\nthe river, and little boys and girls were hastening down to come on\\nboard and sell their cakes and fruit. I did not go on shore, as we were\\nto stay only a short time, but amused myself gazing about, and eating\\nblack and whortleberries which the little buckeye girls sold for ‘a fip\\na quart.’ This town is the southern termination of the Ohio canal whose\\nnorthern outlet we had passed at Cleaveland upon lake Erie. The Scioto\\nriver also enters the Ohio here. It is a pretty stream 175 miles long.\\nIn the country through which it flows is much iron; and forges and\\nfounderies are established in many places around Portsmouth, which is a\\nmarket for their produce. The hills opposite this place are of a grander\\ncharacter than any we had seen upon the Ohio, and now, with the lights\\nand shades of early summer morning upon them, formed a charming picture\\nfor the inhabitants of Portsmouth. I remarked several pretty dwellings\\nsurrounded by shrubbery, which showed there were many here who were\\n‘well to do in the world.’ What delightful residences must these Ohio\\ntowns be, for persons of small fortune, or to tradesmen. All the\\ncomforts of life can be obtained with little expense, while good air,\\nand good laws, shed health and peace around. Our passengers and freight\\nexchanged for others, we turned our course from the shore, and followed\\nthe{249} bends of La Belle riviere, (worthy of its name) as it wound through\\na well settled country, its shadowy hills now appearing more frequently,\\ngiving a more varied character to the scenery. The water grows purer as\\nwe ascend, and shallower, so that we can at times distinguish the sand\\nand stones at the bottom. The Buckeye tree is seen in large groves, or\\npretty groups or copses, giving a very cultivated air to the shores, as\\nwe had been used to see it, ornamenting our streets, under the ugly name\\nhorse-chesnut. But although much alike in external appearance our tree\\nis a transplanted one, originally from Asia, the Æsculus Hippocastinum,\\nwhile this tree is a native of Ohio, designated by the botanist as the\\nÆsculus Ohioensis. There are here seven species of this tree, which from\\ntheir deep green glossy leaves, and pretty flowers are a great ornament\\nto the groves of Ohio. It is an useful tree, and from the softness of\\nits wood is easy to cut. In the early days of Ohio, when the settlers\\nwere in want of many articles of household furniture, they resorted to\\nthe buckeye. After building their log cabins of its branches, they\\nformed, according to Dr. Drake, cradles, tables, bowls, platters,\\nspoons, and troughs for gathering maple sap. The covering of the nut can\\nbe used as soap, while starch and medicine are also procured from it.\\nThe nut being brown, with a round white spot upon it, is called buckeye;\\nand in consequence of their frequent use, and constant praises of this\\ntree, the people of Ohio received from their neighbors the soubriquet of\\nBuckeyes. The western people are fond of these nicknames. I told you the\\nIllinoisians were called Suckers, the Missourians are Pukes; the\\nKentuckians, Corncrackers;{250} Virginians, Tuckahoes; Indianians, Hoosiers;\\nMichiganians, Wolverines, &c.',\n"," 'While sailing, or rather to use the customary phrase here, riding along\\nthese western rivers, one is struck with the destruction of trees. What\\nmagnificent forests we passed to-day, where the huge and towering\\nsycamore, the dark green buckeye, the lighter cotton wood, the tall and\\ngraceful shaft of the sugar maple, the white elm, with its beautifully\\narranged branches and purple flowers, the silvery white maple, the oak,\\nthe beech, woven together by missletoe and other creepers, on the Ohio\\nshore; and on the Kentucky bank, the blue ash, the coffee tree, stately\\ntulip, yellow locust, dark leaved hackberry, basswood, and hundreds of\\nothers, make a mass of glorious forest scenery, such as I am sure earth\\ncannot surpass. But the great rise and fall, and changes of this river,\\nand its shores, destroy hundreds of these noble creations in a year.\\nCountless numbers we saw along the banks, with all their roots exposed,\\nholding but by one slight one, which any blast of wind might loosen,\\nwhen it falls and is washed away. The shores were strewed with them in\\nall stages; many struck down in youth, with their young foliage about\\nthem; others in the sere and yellow leaf, while others again stripped of\\nleaf and bark, are piled in great ‘wreck heaps,’ where the current has\\nhurled them, or floating down the stream, in time to become a snag and\\nlie in wait to impale some unconscious vessel. While looking upon them\\nin their innocence and beauty, I could not but pity their vampire fate,\\nso soon to be transformed into malicious snags, to destroy the passing\\nvoyager. The quantity of yellow clay marl which occurs along the{251}\\nshores, contributes to their destruction, as it easily crumbles away.\\nThis also gives the peculiar rounded form to the Ohio hills, as the marl\\nis washed down, giving the hills a smooth round shape.',\n"," 'At Sandy river, a stream which runs one hundred and sixty miles through\\nVirginia, we bade adieu to old Kentuck. The rich and fertile plains of\\nKentucky were the favorite hunting grounds of the Aborigines of the\\nsurrounding regions, as there the buffalo, elk, deer, &c. roved in large\\nherds. Extremely unwilling to surrender it to the white intruders, the\\nIndians fought long and bravely for it, and so many severe battles took\\nplace there, that Kentucky acquired among the Indians the name of ‘the\\ndark and bloody ground.’ The inhabitants have long been celebrated for\\ntheir valor. Some of the scenery of Kentucky is the most beautiful in\\nthe States, and some of the land the most fertile. It is four hundred\\nmiles long, and contains twenty-six million acres. The wonderful caverns\\nwhich occur in the limestone formations, you have heard of. Population,\\nbetween six and seven hundred thousand. Virginia, the land of the\\ncavaliers, and of Pocahontas, looked very inviting, as we sailed past\\nit; her pretty hills lending beauty to every view. At Guyandot, we\\nlanded a party to visit the Sulphur Springs in Virginia, which are now\\nquite fashionable. Our springs at Saratoga and Ballston, lose many\\nsouthern and western visitors, since these, and so many others have been\\ndiscovered in those regions.',\n"," 'July 22nd.—Off Gallipolis, a town settled by French people, who came\\nhere to avoid the excesses of the revolution. These persons, brought up\\nin a delicate,{252} luxurious manner, were obliged to plunge at once into\\nall the hardships of a woodland life, and suffered much ere their houses\\nwere erected, and all things in order. Upon the opposite shore the\\nKenawha enters the Ohio, after coming from the iron mountain in North\\nCarolina, through Kentucky three hundred miles. It has dug for itself a\\ndeep bed in the limestone rocks, and upon its banks is the most rugged\\nand picturesque scenery in Kentucky. Coal, and salt springs abound along\\nits shores. The rapids of the Ohio came in sight after this, and looked\\ncool and pretty, as the water curled and foamed over the ledges of rocks\\nand pebbles. The water was very clear and we seemed sailing upon the\\nbottom; but being so unusually low, our boat, as small as she was,\\ngrounded several times. In these extremities recourse was had to\\ncordelling. A rope was carried ahead by a small boat, and fastened to\\na rock, or anchored; and a windlass brought the boat up to the rock.\\nAfter passing the rapids, the river becomes shallower and more narrow;\\nbut as our boat only drew twenty inches, we succeeded in going on, while\\nsome larger ones which had accompanied us thus far, were left in the\\nriver, or at some village. The islands are more frequent, and some of\\nthem very lovely, mazes of beautiful forest trees woven together in\\nnatural bowers by pea vines in blossom, scarlet creeper, and many other\\npretty and new plants. The island of the unfortunate Blennarhasset, is\\nthe largest and loveliest, containing seven hundred acres. Through the\\ncircle of forest trees which border it, we caught glimpses of the centre\\nwhich was level, and once highly cultivated. Here he created a paradise\\nof lawns and groves, and gardens, surrounding{253} a dwelling, the residence\\nof his charming family, to which were attached green and hot-houses,\\nlibraries and music rooms. Ambition has rendered this fair spot a\\ndesert; he never rose to the empire which he and his tempter, Burr, had\\nhoped to create. After all, the saddest part of Herman Blennarhasset’s\\nfate is, that every tourist who passes the island, must mention his name\\nand utter an effecting sentimentality about ambition; it seems like\\ndragging him out of his resting place, to hear our taunts; if you travel\\nthis way, let me beg of you—',\n"," 'Parkersburgh at the mouth of the little Kenawha, is a quaint old\\nfashioned town in Virginia; embosomed in hills. Here we intended to land\\nand take the mail stage to Winchester, but it had just departed, and\\nrather than remain there two days, until another stage, we concluded to\\ngo on in the Agnes to Wheeling. Accordingly we and our trunks were again\\non board, and we resumed our rambles. At sunset we stopped, at the town\\nof Marietta, the first spot settled in Ohio. Its name was very prettily\\ngiven in honor of the fair and unfortunate Maria Antoinette of France;\\nin gratitude for the support she gave our cause. The town was laid out\\nin 1788. The streets are wide, and adorned with forest trees, and parks.\\nThe houses are solidly built, having each its ornamented court and\\ngarden. The exchange, court-house, college, churches, and other public\\nbuildings are handsome structures. It is principally settled by New\\nEnglanders, whose love of good order and morality has not been left\\nbehind, for the motto{254} upon the town seal pledges their ‘support of\\nreligion and learning.’ Marietta is upon the Muskingum, which is between\\ntwo and three hundred yards wide, and navigable for one hundred miles\\nwith large boats. It is a remarkably pure, healthy, bright stream,\\n‘rolling its limpid waves over a sandy and pebbly bottom, variegated in\\nsummer months with the open valves of thousands of red and white shells\\nscattered among the sand, rivalling in beauty the richest tessellated\\npavement of the Romans.’ Upon its banks stands Zanesville, a large and\\nhandsome town, and in the county through which this river and its\\nbranches flow, are quantities of iron, coal, salt, limestone, and many\\nother useful productions. There are also ancient mounds and\\nfortifications upon its shores. Marietta appears beautifully as we\\napproach, seated upon an elevated bank, at the foot of a range of the\\npicturesque Ohio hills. These are about three hundred feet high, formed\\nof ‘argillacious earth, based upon sandstone.’ The scenery this\\nafternoon is of a grander cast than any we had yet seen upon the Ohio.\\nThe hills which have generally risen at some distance from the shore,\\nnow come close down to the water, so that, as we ride along we can look\\nfar up into their recesses. They have the same gracefully regular\\nappearance, except that now and then a ledge of sandstone or limestone,\\nbreaks the smooth green side.',\n"," 'I have said very little about the cooking and victuals upon these\\nwestern boats. The latter are very good, and finer beef, fish, bread,\\netc., cannot be found any where; the most fastidious palate might here\\nbe satisfied were it not for one thing—our western brethren are so fond\\nof fat. Almost every dish of animal food is swiming in a greasy liquor.\\nDoubtless I should{255} be used to it in time and like it as well as our\\nyoung southern friend who used to expatiate upon the delights of hominy\\nand ‘possum fat.’ However, I cannot expect persons, wherever I may\\nchoose to travel, to shape their table to please me, so I make a point\\nof taking things as quietly as if I had ordered every thing. I generally\\nsucceeded, by declining gravey, to obtain a piece tolerably dry, and\\nthis, with their excellent vegetables, Indian bread, good butter, and\\nnice stewed dried peaches, the unfailing accompaniment to every meal, to\\nsecure a pleasant and healthful repast. Tea and coffee we have met, of\\nall shades and varieties, but none so unique as the prairie coffee, of\\nwhich I wrote you. The accommodations are comfortable, and in the ladies\\napartment, towels, basins, and water enough, and leave to use your own\\nbrushes. The gentlemen were confined to tin washbowls upon deck, but if\\nany one chose to ask, he might always have a basin and towel in his\\ncabin. We found nothing to complain of as serious annoyances, but\\nreceived every attention and politeness from captains and servants.{256}',\n"," '\\nWheeling, Virginia July 23d.\\n',\n"," 'Although weary of the constant jar of these high pressure steamboats,\\nand glad once more to step upon firm land, yet, when told Wheeling was\\nin sight, I felt regret that I must now turn my back upon the beautiful\\nOhio and the charming western land. I ought not to leave the fair State\\nof Ohio without saying a few words to give you an idea of its extent and\\ncondition—matters which you may perhaps extract from Gazateers\\nyourself, but this will save you the trouble. Gazateers and tourists\\nguides, however, are of little use in a region which so rapidly changes\\nits appearance, and increases its population. Where you are directed to\\nremark the beauty of a grand forest, you find a large town, and where,\\nwhen the book was written, spread out a fair prairie, you find a country\\ncovered with farm houses, cornfields, fences and orchards. Along the\\ncoast of Ohio we have sailed over an hundred miles on lake Erie, and\\nupon the Ohio river, four hundred miles. From Cincinnati here, which is\\nall that distance, except twenty{257} or thirty miles we paid twelve\\ndollars, six each; which, with board for three days, is not expensive\\ntravelling. The State of Ohio is nearly square, being two hundred and\\ntwenty-two miles long by two hundred broad, and with Indiana and\\nIllinois, are parts of a great plain which inclines to the Mississippi,\\nthrough which the rivers have cut their way into their deep beds. The\\ngeology of these States is very much the same, they being based upon\\nthat great secondary limestone formation which reaches from the eastern\\nStates to the Chippewayan mountains, and from the great lakes to the\\nalluvion of the southern States. This is doubtless the deposite of the\\nprimitive ocean, as it occurs ‘in layers of chrystaline and sedimentary,\\nor in broken pieces cemented together.’[26] It is of all shades, from\\nthe dark brown ferruginous, to the light grey, the blue fœtid, the\\nyellow silecious, and magnesian, the argillaceous, earthy, chrystaline\\noolitic, etc. In this limestone formation is a variety of fossil shells\\nof many species, as the ammonites, spiriferi, encrini, producti,\\ncorallines, gryphea, madrepores, and various others. Its thickness is\\nenormous, for it has been penetrated one thousand feet without reaching\\nthe primitive rocks.[27] Above this is the sandstone, and slate, and\\nclay of the coal measures, and muriatiferous rocks. These sandstones are\\ngenerally white ash color, or brown; a very little red has been\\ndiscovered in this valley. One of our western friends, who has well\\nstudied the geology of that region, was of opinion that all the groups\\nof fossiliferous secondary strata recognized and determined by European\\ngeologists have not been discovered here; but that{258} they claim the upper\\nnew, red sandstone and oolites, that have not been subdivided; that\\nabove the oolites they have unconsolidated strata of great extent and\\nthickness, which do not abound in fossils, and have not been\\nsufficiently observed to justify and attempt to confer names upon them.\\nSeveral of the groups of the European secondary are thought to be\\nwanting here. The chalk group is certainly wanting; nor have any of the\\nfour received divisions of the supercretaceous, or tertiary, been\\nidentified in the western valley. The older pliocene, and it is thought\\nthe newer, have been observed in Alabama. The recent pliocene is here\\nestablished; the accumulation of gigantic fossil remains; of mammalia at\\nBig Bone Lick, Kentucky; at Bucyrus, Ohio; at Pomme de Terre, Missouri;\\nand at Rocky Spring, near St. Louis, identify this group with certainty.\\nThe recent pliocene is not horizontal, it having been seen fifteen\\nhundred feet or more above the level of the sea. Its remains of\\nelephants, tetracaulidons, and other fossils identical with existing\\ngenera upon the earth demonstrates its geological era to be near us.\\nThere are several remarkable deposites in Ohio and the surrounding\\nStates—the sileceous, ferruginous, muriatiferous, and the coal. The\\nsileceous deposite, sometimes called ‘Flint ridge,’ runs nearly through\\nthe State of Ohio, in a south-westerly direction from the Tuscarawas\\nriver, to the Sciota, near the Ohio. Its greatest width is four or five\\nmiles, being strewed over the ground in broken masses; beneath the soil;\\nor, which is its most common situation, upon the tops of the hills;\\ndoubtless thrown up from the ocean in a fluid and heated state. This\\ndeposite occurs generally white, but is occa{259}sionally streaked with\\nvarious hues, and is compact, cellular, and vermicular. The aboriginal\\ninhabitants made great use of it for arrow heads; and the present\\nsettlers find it very valuable as whet-stones, hones, and mill-stones.\\nThe latter are thought equal to the French buhr stone, and are sold to\\nthe amount of twenty thousand dollars a year. Those from the deposite\\nupon Raccoon creek, are very celebrated. In this silecious material\\noccurs marine shells, beautiful and limpid quartz chrystals, veins of\\nchalcedony, sulphate of barytes, flint, hornstone, and various other\\nminerals.',\n"," 'The ferruginous deposite crosses the State from north-east to\\nsouth-west, commencing at the division line between Ohio and\\nPennsylvania, upon lake Erie, to the mouth of the Sciota, and thence\\ncontinues into Kentucky, to the Cumberland mountains, its average width\\nbeing from fifteen to twenty miles. The iron occurs in several\\nvarieties, as a brown oxide, an argillaceous ore, pure, highly\\ncarbonated ore, etc. Its forms are also various; the ore occurring\\nlamellated, disseminated in kidney shaped masses, columnar, stalactitic,\\ncubic, in rhombic fragments, nodules, etc. It is extensively worked in\\nmany furnaces of Ohio and Kentucky. In this iron are marine shells and\\nplants of a tropical climate.',\n"," 'I have spoken of the muriatiferous rocks, and I will now pass on to the\\ncoal measures. The quantity of coal found in these western States is\\nwonderful. The valley of the Ohio, and it now appears the valley of the\\nMississippi are underlaid with coal. The Alleghany mountains are filled\\nwith it; at their bases it is heaped up in masses, probably of\\nantediluvial vegetation, by the eddies of the currents. These moun{260}tains\\nseem to divide the anthracite from the bituminous coal. There is enough\\nof this article in Ohio to last thousands of years, twelve thousand\\nsquare miles being underlaid with it in one grand basin. In Indiana,\\naccording to Dr. Owen, the coal formation occupies seven thousand seven\\nhundred and eighty square miles; in Pennsylvania, the bituminous coal\\nembraces an area of twenty-one thousand square miles; while in the\\nStates west of these, coal is found in considerable quantities, but it\\nhas not been thoroughly examined. The richest deposit of coal in the\\nvalley of the Ohio, is the basin through which runs the Monongahela\\nriver; it is two hundred miles in length and one hundred in breadth.[28]\\nIt occurs extensively in layers across the hills—that of Coal hill at\\nPittsburg, supplies the city, which it uses in its great manufactories.\\nThe coal consumed in this city and its suburbs is estimated at ‘seven\\nmillions six hundred and sixty-five thousand bushels.’ This useful\\narticle is easily procured throughout the west and is consequently very\\ncheap, being two, four, or eight cents a bushel in different places. The\\niron and salt furnaces, and manufactories of the west owe their present\\nflourishing trade to the abundance of this material. This coal is black\\nbituminous generally; burns freely, and in some deposits, forms very\\ngood coke which is used in the furnaces. In Licking Co., Ohio is a\\ndeposit of Canal coal, and another in Guernsey Co. Beside these\\ninteresting minerals there are numerous others in the Ohio valley which\\nare very valuable; upon Wills creek Ohio is a deposit of fine lias\\nlimestone—and there are in the State{261} various other stones suitable for\\nbuilding,—sandstones of fine quality used for architectural\\npurposes,—gypsum, lead, copper &c. The coal measures abound in organic\\nremains; some of them belonging to the tropical palms and ferns are very\\nbeautiful and perfect. When we see how important these articles are to\\nthe western land, and how profusely they are scattered and how easily\\nobtained, one cannot think they are thus arranged by accidental\\nconvulsions of nature. We know that the greatest coal deposits are above\\nthe thirtieth degree of latitude, and is not this because the\\ninhabitants below this degree do not so much require it, while the\\ncolder countries would be almost deserts without it, so good and\\nbeneficient is our great Father. You will say I am like the old woman\\nwho praised the goodness of God for making rivers flow by the side of\\ncities. I think there is double enjoyment in every gift when we feel it\\nis from His compassionate hand. Ohio is one of the finest agricultural\\ncountries in the world. Her productions are justly celebrated for their\\ngoodness and quantity. Her exports in flour last year is said to be\\nseven million five hundred thousand dollars. The land belonging to the\\ngovernment sells here, as in the other States for one dollar and\\ntwenty-five cents an acre. Around large towns the owner of the lots asks\\nof course more. We must bid Ohio now adieu and look around us a little.\\nWe were approaching Wheeling when I thus digressed. It appears very well\\nfrom the water; you see a circle of swelling green hills with the bright\\nriver encircling a large island in the midst. The town runs in a long\\nline across the slope of one of the hills, while a group of steamboats\\nlooking{262} wonderfully like a flock of geese were floating upon the water\\nbeneath. People are busy taking out coal from the hills, and trundling\\nit down a wooden rail-way into the vessels below. The hills are between\\ntwo, and three hundred feet high; the coal stretches along their face\\nfor fifteen miles and then dips into the earth. It is a kind valuable\\nfor cooking, and some of it is beautifully irridescent. The\\nmanufactories of Wheeling are supplied with it and it is extensively\\nsold down the river, at the cost of three cents a bushel when delivered\\nto the boat. One million five hundred thousand bushels of coal are\\nexported from Wheeling every year. Wheeling is a second Pittsburg\\nblackened with coal; while the smoke is rising from forge, and furnace,\\nand chimney, in every direction. Here we found the best landing of any\\ntown upon the river, as the steep bank was walled up, and we ascended by\\na long flight of steps. When upon the top of the wharf we found\\nourselves before a range of shops and hotels, while before us was the\\n‘United States,’ where we deposited ourselves and luggage. After tea we\\nset out for a stroll through the town accompanied by a very agreeable\\nparty who had left the boat with us, the remainder of our passengers\\ngoing on to Pittsburg, about ninety miles farther. We had been through\\nso many new towns that this looked quite antique, it being settled in\\nseventeen hundred and seventy by Col. Zane and his brothers, who\\nafterwards founded Zanesville. The streets here run along the face of\\nthe hill, and contain many shops, manufactories, a large court-house,\\nhotels, banks and dwellings. Among the buildings are seven churches, an\\nacademy, iron and brass foun{263}deries, flint glass works, paper and saw\\nmills, steam engine and machinery works, nail factory, cordage, wire\\nfloorcloth factories &c. Eight stages arrive and depart each day,\\nSundays excepted, and various steamboats stop here—so if you know of\\nany mechanics or trades-people complaining of want of work in your\\ncrowded city tell them to wend their way hitherward. All kind of\\nlaborers will find business enough in the west. I think a society for\\nexporting over the Alleghanies the poor European emigrants who are\\nsuffering in our large cities, would be of great service to them and to\\nus. The population we were told nearly numbered ten thousand. Among the\\nhouses we observed one quite large and handsome; this we were told was\\nbuilt by Col. Zane, when the town was first settled and his descendants\\nhave resided there since. He was an active pioneer of the wilderness,\\nand encountered many difficulties, and fought many battles with the\\nIndians ere he was permanently settled in his beautiful abode. In these\\nattacks the females of Wheeling showed much heroism and took an active\\npart in the affray. The little settlement was once attacked by three\\nhundred and eighty Indians when Col. Zane had with him but thirty-three\\nmen, but the women shouldered their rifles, joined in the battle and did\\nmuch execution. Once, in despair, the garrison inclined to a surrender,\\nbut a young girl named Betsey Wheat, answered them in such an eloquent\\nand indignant burst of irony that they rallied and defeated the enemy.\\nIn a second attack Elizabeth, the sister of Col. Zane, saved the fort by\\nbringing into it a quantity of powder, braving, but passing unhurt\\nthrough the whizzing balls directed against her by the Indians.{264} Some of\\nthe buildings here are of the light sandstone of the country.',\n"," 'July 24th.—We were aroused early by the trampling of steeds and upon\\nlooking out beheld several fine stages each having four horses which\\nwere soon to start upon their different roads. Our breakfast over we\\nwith the party mentioned above entered a large convenient coach and just\\nas the clock struck seven left the hotel. Upon reaching the top of the\\nhill above the town we looked down upon as fair a scene as any we had\\nseen in our travels. The town was strewed over the hill below us, while\\nthe beautiful Ohio lay like a circlet of silver around a pretty island\\ncovered with waving corn and dotted with farm-houses, and then glided\\naway in its course winding among the soft green hills until it\\ndisappeared behind one of them. The island is Zane’s island, containing\\nthree hundred and fifty acres. We had now looked our last upon the\\nlovely valley of the Ohio, and its beautiful river the Belle riviere of\\nthe French, and Ohio Peekhanne of the Indian. This valley is from the\\nsources of the Ohio to the Mississippi eleven hundred miles in length,\\nand nearly three hundred miles in breadth. It sweeps down from the\\nAlleghanies at an elevation of two thousand two hundred and thirty feet\\nto the Ohio and then ascends gently four hundred feet to the ridge which\\ndivides its waters from those which flow into the gulf of St. Lawrence,\\na distance of nearly three hundred miles. Through this valley winds in\\ngraceful bends the noble Ohio eleven hundred miles from its source, and\\nnine hundred and forty-eight from its junction with the{265} Monongohela at\\nPittsburg. It divides the valley in two unequal portions, having one\\nhundred and sixteen thousand square miles upon the south-east side, and\\neighty thousand upon the north-west. This valley enjoys a pleasant\\ntemperature not too cold to paralyze exertion, and not so warm as to\\nenervate. Its soil is capable of yielding fruits, vegetables, and\\ngrains, of the finest quality and in great profusion, and mineral\\nproducts of the utmost importance to man; and it is settled by a free,\\nvirtuous, and enlightened people; add to this the scenery is beautiful\\nand varied, and I think you will look far to find a region of country\\nuniting so many advantages. The dark clouds of slavery which shadow its\\nborders is the only spot in its fair horizon. The valley of the Ohio is\\nin the centre of a great plain, which as the Appalachian chain was\\nelevated raised up that portion, and consequently the rivers which flow\\nover that division come with more impetuosity and dig for themselves\\ndeep trenches in the earth. Many who have carefully examined this region\\nare of opinion the regular hills which border the Ohio and many of its\\ntributaries, are parts of the primitive plain, which the streams have\\nworn down into their present shapes. In this valley lies that great coal\\nbasin which is so ably described by Dr. Hildreth in the American Journal\\nof Science. It extends over four or five degrees of latitude, and as\\nmany of longitude. A circle drawn from the head waters of the Muskingum\\nto the sources of the Alleghany, and from thence to those of the\\nMonongohela and Kenawha would mark the extent of this deposit,\\ncomprising portions of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky.',\n"," 'Adieu to the fair Ohio! It has carried us for nearly{266} nine hundred miles\\nin safety upon its bosom, unharmed by snag or sawyer; and I say with\\nMilton,',\n"," 'Our day’s journey was very delightful. The country is rolling, and\\nalternately pretty hill and dale scenery, and winding rivulets. The\\nfirst part of our ride was through Virginia, but in a short time at the\\nvillage of Alexandria, we entered Pennsylvania. We drove over the\\nnational road, which runs from Cumberland, in Maryland, and passes\\nthrough the intervening States to Vandalia, Illinois, from whence it is\\nexpected to be finished to Alton. This is a firm McAdamized road, eighty\\nfeet broad, carried over mountains, vallies and rivers, crossing the\\nlatter as well as every ravine and depression by well built stone\\nbridges. This very useful and well executed work was done by government,\\nat the suggestion of our statesman, Henry Clay. We passed a neat farm\\nhouse, before which stood a bronze statue of Clay, placed there by a\\nwidow lady, owner of the place, in gratitude for the benefit this road\\nhad produced to her property. We of course were in duty bound to admire\\nthe statue, while rolling so rapidly and smoothly over this excellent\\nroad. At Washington, Pa., we dined; a pretty town, having three\\nchurches, hotels, and shops, with a college, a large building, in the\\ncentre of pleasant grounds. A large court-house, of brick, was in\\nprogress. The{267} dinner was good, but plain. The hills which we passed in\\nthe afternoon, were covered with rich pasture land, where sheep and\\ncattle were making a fine feast. These grassy hills are famous for the\\n‘glade butter,’ which is celebrated around the country, and which we\\nfound very sweet and fresh. While descending the side of one of these\\nhills, we were told Brownsville, Pa., was in sight, and looking down, we\\nbeheld a town in the valley, with the pretty Monongohela glistening in\\nthe bright sun, as it wound its way around the hills. Rattling over a\\nfine, strong, covered bridge, we stopped to change horses before the\\nprincipal hotel. This is a large manufacturing town, containing five\\nthousand inhabitants. Steamboats are here built, and completely fitted\\nup; and when the river is high, they run to Pittsburg, sixty miles\\ndistant. The hills are high around, abounding in bituminous coal, and\\nlaid with strata of limestone and sandstone. The coal here is very rich.\\nDark, heavy masses, after we had left this place, began to appear in the\\nhorizon, and we were rejoiced to hear they were the celebrated Alleghany\\nmountains. We took tea at Uniontown, Pa., at the foot of the chesnut\\nridge, and soon after began to ascend the mountain. Our mountain ride\\nwas delightful, and when near the summit we all descended from the stage\\ncoach, to enjoy the views. What a glorious thing to stand upon the top\\nof a mountain! How exultingly you gaze upon the world below! You feel so\\nproud of the great feat you have performed; you breathe freer; the\\nheavens seem nearer and brighter, and the earth—but do not let me speak\\nagainst the earth, for never had it looked more enchanting than when\\nlooking upon{268} it from the summit of the Alleghanies. The fair fields of\\nPennsylvania, were spread out below, varied with herbage of every shade;\\nwith groves and villages, and streams, whose waters were tinted with\\nrose from the setting sun; around in every direction was a green ocean\\nof hill tops, robed in a vesture of purple haze. You will smile at my\\nheroics upon the summit of so small a mountain as one of the\\nAlleghanies, scarcely three thousand feet above the earth, and think it\\nbetter applied to the Chimborazo, Popocatapetl, or even Rocky Mountains;\\nbut fortunately, I have never been upon higher ground, and enjoy the\\nview from the Appalachian range, as much as if I stood upon the Nevados\\nof our southern continent, twenty-five thousand feet above the sea.\\nDepend upon it, those who have seen every thing, who have been rowed\\ndown the Nile; climbed the rocks of Petra; worshipped at Jerusalem;\\ntoiled up the Himalayas; and frozen in Siberia, are no happier than we,\\nwho have been creeping about the circle of our home. To everything you\\ncall upon them to admire they answer, ‘J’ai vu;’ they have seen\\neverything. If you praise a song, they turn away with scorn and speak of\\nthe opera at Naples; if you ask them to visit our springs or our cities,\\nthey talk of the spa’s of Europe, of Paris, of London, and Petersburgh.\\nThey have nothing to do but fold their hands, grumble at the present,\\nand live upon the past. I have not seen, and therefore may be allowed to\\nexpatiate upon the beauties of the Alleghanies. All that night we drove\\nup the hills and down the hills, shut up in the stage coach. We were\\nglad of our cloaks, for it was very cold, and at every stopping place we\\nfound fires,{269} although at the foot of the mountains the thermometer\\nstood at eighty. We talked merrily at first and kept up each others\\nspirits, but towards midnight we grew cold and weary, and one after\\nanother sank into silence. There was much nodding and dozing, but little\\nsleeping; for as soon as one fell into a doze another was sure to ask\\nyou if you could sleep, or how you came on, a question sure to put to\\nflight your endeavors. At last, hopeless of sleep, we gave it up by\\nmutual consent, and tried to amuse each other by stories. One of our\\nparty was a western merchant who had frequently travelled over these\\nmountains, and met with numerous adventures. He told us of an adventure\\nwhich befel him twenty years since, when the mountains were little\\ntravelled, and only accessible on horseback. He was carrying a large sum\\nof money in his saddle-bags, which he feared had been discovered by two\\nill looking men whom he had seen in the tavern where he had stopped just\\nat dusk. He for some time felt a little fear, but the night had nearly\\nworn away and he had not seen any one; when, soon after midnight, as he\\nwas pacing slowly along, he fancied he caught a glimpse of a man\\nstanding by the road side just before him. He gazed intently through the\\ndarkness and saw distinctly two men who drew farther out of the\\nmoonlight into the shade of the trees as he approached. He knew not what\\nto do; he was not armed, no house was near, and if he left the road he\\nmust be lost in the pathless woods. Go on he must, and he determined to\\nput spurs to his horse and dart past them. He gazed forward to see if\\nhis path were clear; a deep silence reigned around, when ‘Dismount and\\ngive up your{270} money!’ resounded like thunder in his ears, echoing away\\namong the silent aisles of the mountain forest. Two men were before him;\\nhis whip was wrenched from his hands; he was dragged to the ground; the\\nrobbers mounted his steed and rode away. ‘Well, there I was in a pretty\\nfix, anyhow,’ he said, ‘sitting upon a mound of snow all alone, in a\\nwild wood at midnight, my two hundred dollars and my horse all gone. I\\nmight have said with Shakspeare’s queen, ‘Here I in sorrow sit,’ etc.,\\nbut I was not in a poetical mood anyhow. Besides, I could blame no one\\nbut myself, for I ought to have kept my eye skinned, and not have been\\nso blind as not to see the danger of travelling in wild parts with so\\nmuch gold. Still, if the parts were wild, we had never heard of any\\nrobbery committed here, and did not expect it.’ ‘Did you ever discover\\nthe robbers?’ we asked. ‘Oh, yes! I went back to the village, and every\\none turned out to help me. There was snow on the ground and we were thus\\nable to track them. I was forced to go all the way to Buffalo, however,\\nere one was caught by the police. He had lived like a prince all along\\nthe road and spent his share of the money.’ ‘What became of the other\\nman?’ ‘Why, ma’am, as I was one day walking through Pratt street, in\\nBaltimore, some months after, whom should I meet but my man, dressed in\\nthe newest style, parading along as proud as a prairie cock, with a\\ngrand lady upon each arm. I knew him, as I had remarked him at the\\ntavern, and by the bright moonlight. He also remembered me, and when he\\nsaw my eye so eagerly fixed upon him, without saying good bye to the\\nladies, or even waiting upon them home, he scattered at once down the{271}\\nstreet, and I after him. If you had seen the ladies stare! Away he went,\\nup street, down street, along the wharves, in the vessels, out again. At\\nlast, thinking he had dodged me, he sprang into an empty hogshead. But I\\nwasn’t to be did that way anyhow; so I flung a board over the top, and\\nstanding on it, clapped my arms and crowed in such a tone of triumph,\\nthat all the cocks in the neighboring yards crowed in concert. In short\\nmy man was treed and imprisoned, but my money was gone.’',\n"," 'July 25th.—At day-break I lifted the curtain, and by the uncertain\\nlight of dawn, beheld at my side a wide river, whose opposite shores\\nwere green and hilly. ‘Are we over the mountains already? What river can\\nthis be?’ I asked. With a smile, one of the party informed me we were on\\nthe summit of a high mountain, and the deep valley filled with mist,\\nwith the opposite summits for a shore, made my river. A bright sun soon\\ndispersed the mist, and we were never tired of the variety of views we\\nbeheld upon every hand. That the mountains are not very high adds to the\\nbeauty of the scene; their heads are not lost in the clouds, and we\\nfrequently see the whole mass at once. While descending one Alleghany we\\nbeheld another before us, like a high green wall reaching to the\\nheavens, while a line across the summit showed the road we were to\\ntravel; so high and precipitous it seemed, that we wondered how we ever\\nshould reach the road. Descending again this ridge, we gazed out over a\\ngreat extent of country, or down into deep valleys, brightened by\\nwinding streams, while trees, and flowers, and vines of every tint and\\nform, adorned{272} the path. The laurels were out of bloom, but their deep\\ngreen glossy leaves shone out continually from the foliage. The chesnut\\nwas also frequent; these two giving names to the two ridges we had\\npassed, Laurel and Chesnut ridges. We also remarked the pretty striped\\nmaple, whose green bark is striped with black. This is sometimes called\\nmoose wood, as the moose-deer always seeks with avidity its tender\\nleaves and bark. The box elder also occurs upon these slopes, with the\\nholly, and varieties of the magnolia, the turpelo, gum tree, besides\\nnoble forests of many other trees. The road although leading over\\nmountain ridges and passes, is not a lonely one, as stages loaded with\\npassengers, were continual passing, and huge Pennsylvanian waggons with\\nthe large Normandy horses, high collar, and jingling a bell to give\\nnotice of their approach. The women of the country we often met upon\\nhorseback, sitting upon their gaily embroidered saddles. The fine broad\\nsmooth National road over which we were passing enabled the drivers to\\nkeep their horses upon a very quick trot. I am fond of rapid driving,\\nbut sometimes it made me rather nervous to dash at the rate of eight\\nmiles an hour, within two feet of a precipice down which we looked upon\\nthe tops of trees a thousand feet below. There is, however, very little\\ndanger, as where the descent is steep, the driver can, in a moment, by\\nputting his foot upon a spring at his side, cramp the wheel, and check\\nour speed. After ascending a high mountain, we found a tavern, whose\\nsign bore the hospitable words ‘Welcome from the west.’ We were much\\npleased with this kind reception, until upon looking back, perceived\\nupon the other side of the{273} sign ‘welcome from the east.’ I wish the\\ngood lady who erected a statue to Clay, would place a monument upon the\\nAlleghanies, to commemorate honest Daniel Boon, who claims to be the\\nfirst who discovered the fair western plains. Sir Alexander Spotswood, a\\ngovernor of Virginia, penetrated part of the way through the mountains.\\nThere was no National road then, and the hills were almost impassable.\\nTo stimulate discovery, he instituted the order of the golden\\nhorse-shoe, for those who could pass the Blue Ridge. He was anxious to\\ncounteract the influence of the French upon the Mississippi. There\\nshould also be a statue to good old Father Marquette, upon the shore of\\nLake Michigan, as, before him, no white man had penetrated farther in\\nthe wilderness. He persevered and discovered the Mississippi. We passed\\nseveral towns, as Smythfield, Petersburg, Frostburg, Cumberland, &c.\\nThis last town is in Maryland, upon a branch of the Potomac, one hundred\\nand forty miles from Baltimore. The scenery around it is beautiful. It\\nlies in a valley, through which glistens the Potomac river, surrounded\\nby mountains. We reached it this morning, after descending a slope which\\nseemed to rise one mass of rocks above us. The town has several large\\nhotels, a college, court-house, and many shops. We stopped here to\\nchange horses. Here commences the transition formations, the Appalachian\\nrange, dividing the transition from the secondary formations of the\\nwestern valley. So clear and distinct is this division, that the\\ncelebrated geologist, Dr. Aikin, fixed upon the ground between\\nCumberland and Hancock, forty miles distant, as the spot where the\\nAppalachian chain emerged from beneath, upheaved{274} by igneous action. The\\nmountain which we descended to Cumberland, is called the Alleghany by\\npre-eminence, it being the highest elevation, and is the ridge which\\ndivides the waters which flow into the Ohio, from those which reach the\\nAtlantic. The rocks which we had observed upon our road, were the usual\\nlimestone, marl, and conglomerates of the west, mixed with much\\nbituminous coal, while now we remarked with them, grey wacke and\\ntransition slates. The Baltimore and Ohio railroad will pass through\\nCumberland, and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. Here also the National\\ncommences, and we there left it, but found a very good one which\\ncontinued, with some failures, during the day. We dined at Pine Grove, a\\nsmall village. Near the hotel is a sulphur spring, which we were obliged\\nto taste, to gratify the landlord, and which was as nauseous as one\\ncould desire. This afternoon we passed some very pretty mountain\\nscenery; none so high as those we had left behind, for we were only upon\\nthe steps which lead down from the ridge to the plains below. From\\nSidling Hill we looked down into a large valley surrounded by a circle\\nof hills, through which a river winding its way formed several islands.\\nIn the centre, was a high rounded knoll covered with fields of ripened\\ngrain, its bright yellow contrasting well with the dark woods which\\nsurround it. They have a curious way here of laying the grain when cut,\\nin squares or circles, which looks very pretty at a distance. We took\\ntea at Hancock, a town upon the banks of the Potomac. The Chesapeake and\\nOhio canal is finished as far as this place. We were but little over\\nhalf way to Baltimore here, having come, we were told, one hundred and\\nsixty{275} miles from Wheeling. Another night was passed in the stage, only\\nvaried by occasional stoppages to change horses. About day-break we\\nstopped at Hagarstown, a very large, thriving place, containing\\nchurches, academies, and many handsome private dwellings. The hotel\\nwhich we entered while the horses were changed, was large, and seemed\\nvery commodious. After leaving it, we found the valley in which it\\nstands, was very highly cultivated. It is underlaid with a dark blue\\nlimestone; the soil is very rich, and the wheat which it produces, is\\nsent to Baltimore, and highly esteemed. We saw some of this limestone\\nwhich occasionally cropped out; veins of calcareous spar crossed the\\nblue, in some instances. Quartz pebbles, and large nodules were spread\\nover the country for miles, between this town and Frederic, as if a\\nstorm of enormous hail had spent its fury over the land. Rounded pieces,\\nas large as a man’s fist, and white as milk, lay against the fences, or\\nwere piled up by the husbandman. The county to Frederic is very pretty,\\nundulating, cultivated, and well settled, while dark masses in the\\ndistant horizon told us our pretty mountains were far behind us.',\n"," 'July 26th.—At eleven o’clock, we reached Frederick city, where we\\nbreakfasted. This is a very pretty city, having an air of antiquity; as\\nwe now had arrived in an old settled country, and the newly painted\\ntowns were giving place to what are called old, although not what an\\nEuropean would deem aged. I was almost too sleepy to see much of it, but\\nas we rattled over paved streets, and looked upon rows of houses, we\\nseemed quite at home again.{276}',\n"," 'We bade adieu to the stage-coach, and after a good breakfast, entered\\nthe rail-road car, and were whirled along with a rapidity which was\\nfrightful, after our stage-coach pace. The cars were handsomely\\nfinished, having an apartment appropriated to the ladies, where\\nreclining upon the blue satin sofas we relieved our cramped limbs. The\\ncountry, between Frederick and Baltimore, is very pretty. I think it is\\nabout sixty miles from the one place to the other. We passed many good\\nhouses, surrounded with fine farms, having the shining Monocasy river,\\nwinding among them. We crossed this and the Petapsco, over several\\nbridges. The latter river flows between high banks of granite. Fifteen\\nmiles, from Baltimore, are the celebrated Ellicots mills, built of the\\ngranite of the cliffs, upon which they stand, where is ground the\\nexcellent Baltimore flour, raised from the fertile country around\\nFrederick and Hagarstown. Some of the deep cuts of the rail-road seem to\\nbe through a mass of debris, of all colours, red, white, and blue, mixed\\nwith talcose slate, and blue limestone, until near Baltimore, when we\\nentered that granitic belt, which stretched through the Atlantic, border\\nto Georgia, and which is supposed once to have been the original\\nAtlantic coast, before the band of alluvion was formed. After passing\\nmany fanciful country seats, and the fine viaduct which leads to\\nWashington, we beheld Baltimore, an enormous mass of brick and stone\\nlying upon the shore of Petapsco bay. Our western friends were delighted\\nand surprised at the sight of so large a city while driving through the\\nstreet. We arrived at Barnham’s large and elegant hotel just as they\\nwere eating dinner. We had infringed upon our Sabbath{277} thus far, without\\nintending it, as we were told we should arrive in Baltimore in time for\\nmorning services. In the afternoon and evening, however, there was\\nopportunity of joining in public worship, which my husband and some of\\nthe party embraced, leaving us, the weaker part, at home to rest.',\n"," 'July 27th.—As we did not leave Baltimore until half-past nine, we\\nwere enabled to see much of it. Its monuments to Washington, and to the\\nheroes of the last war, are handsome, and the fountain with its cool\\ncanopy of shadowy elms, pretty; its churches and public buildings very\\ngood, but as you are so well acquainted with it, I will not trouble you\\nwith any details. We entered the rail-road car at half-past nine, and\\nreached New York at eleven that night, a distance of two hundred miles,\\nfor which we paid eight dollars each. Several long bridges carried us\\nover Bush creek, Gunpowder river, and the noble Susquehanna. Our western\\nfriends, who had been boasting of their great rivers, seemed surprised\\nat the little use we made of them in travelling. ‘It seems,’ said our\\nfair Missouri lady, ‘rivers here are of no consequence—indeed, are in\\nthe way, as you make bridges and drive over them.’',\n"," 'At one o’clock we reached Wilmington, the capitol of Delaware. This\\nState was a Swedish settlement, named by Gustavus Adolphus, Nova Suecia,\\nsince which time, Dutch, English and Americans, have successively owned\\nit.',\n"," 'We dined at Wilmington, and then hastening on, passed through Chester,\\nand a rich level country, to the beautiful city of Philadelphia. Leaving\\nour rail{278}road at the depot, we drove through the whole length of the\\ncity, where, at five o’clock, we entered the cars again, turned our\\nfaces towards New York, which we reached, as I said, at eleven o’clock,\\nthe road being along the Delaware, and through some rich farms, with\\nelegant mansions and huge Pennsylvania barns; through Bristol and\\nTrenton, in New Jersey, when darkness spread over the land and we saw no\\nmore.

swerved from the river and in a few minutes we found ourselvesin the midst of the little village of Niagara When the train stopped wewere surrounded by a host of porters struggling to secure us for theirseveral favorite hotels We chose the Cataract house from a friend’srecommendation and from its appropriate name We had no cause to repentour decision as its accommodation and attendance were every thing wecould wish We were shown into a neat chamber which to my delightlooked out upon the rushing rapids The tea bell rang as we entered andmuch to the annoyance of my impatient spirit my companion made it plainto me I should refresh myself before visiting the Falls Tea over I hadleave to go and we were soon upon the pathway Shall I take you at onceinto the presence chamber of the divinity or shall I describe the hallsand corridors as I pass through them to her throne I think a minutedescription will best please you Niagara river just55 before it reachesthe fall is divided into two parts one rushing past the Canada shoreplunges over the rocks making the crescent or horseshoe fall—thisfall is about one hundred and sixty feet high The other half of theriver passes around an island called Goat or Iris island and fallsfrom the American side This island has been sacred from the foot of manuntil a few years since when a bridge was thrown across the rapids withmuch dexterity and daring Upon this bridge we will walk if you pleasestopping one moment to view the rapids These constitute a verybeautiful feature of the scene and were it not for the falls would bewell worth a visit on their own account The river is a mile wide andcomes rushing and foaming over rocks some ten or twelve feet highlooking seafaring men tell us very much like breakers or a sea in astorm—the green waves heightening the illusion One is glad to besafely over this tumultuous water especially as the former bridge hasbeen carried away From the bridge you land upon Bath island containingabout two acres of land upon which is erected a tollhouse and shopfor the sale of Indian curiosities and canes There are also bathinghouses here A short bridge brings us to Goat Island onehalf a milelong and a quarter wide It is also called Iris and as such I shalldesignate it The increased roar the mist rising above the trees urgeyou on and you pass the ‘curiosity shop’ and refreshments here offeredand hasten on through many a winding forest path until you gain theopposite side of the island where you find yourself upon the brink of adeep gulf into which an ocean broken loose from its bounds isprecipitated with astounding noise and violence56 This is thecrescent fall on the Canadian shore But linger not here Descend theisland to the brink of the river and cross the rapids over a totteringfrail bridge to the tower which stands upon the precipice at the edgeof the falls Ascend to the top and lean over the railing look calmlydown if you can into the fathomless abyss of ocean where the waves aredashing the foam whirling and the winds rushing amid the roar of athousand thunders eternally ascending Deafened confounded bewilderedyou retreat in haste fearful every moment the breakers which aredashing against the tower will tear it away from its foundation andplunge you into the fearful ocean depths below At this place and upontable rock opposite you see Niagara in all its power and terror But ifyou would behold it in all its ravishing beauty you must go as we didthe next morning before sunrise and view it from the ferry house Toreach this spot you do not cross to Iris island but follow the riverbank to the American fall near which is the ferryman’s cottage and ata little distance the ladder which leads you down to the boat Seatedupon a rock in front of the cottage we feasted our eyes with unearthlybeauty Beside you is the American fall tinged with a delicate apple orberyl green hue One delights to follow with the eye this fairtranslucent arch as it plunges far down into the water nearly twohundred feet below us You have but a sideling view of this fall hereLooking past it you see the dark foliage of Iris island and beyond theCanadian fall This immense mass of water falls over rocks in the formof a crescent and is tinted with an elysian loveliness which you havenever beheld and never can57 conceive let me write pages upon it Earthhas never produced water of the like hue something of the emerald butmore rich more vivid This green spotted and embroidered as it iswith wreaths of snow white foam presents the most charming and uniqueeffect imaginable In some places the water pitches over perfectlysmooth as if an emerald arch and so pellucid that you may distinctlysee through it the white foam that is churned from the rocks over whichit flows As we reached the spot from whence this is seen the sun aroseabove the trees and immediately two glorious rainbows spanned the riverfrom shore to shore and the mist which was rising high in the air tookthe tint of the rose which faded only to be replaced by the mostgorgeous prismatic hues Never had imagination pictured any thing soglorious as that scene a tremendous fall of green and white water agay colored rainbow rosy mist azure sky and shores of various shadesIt was a creation which belonged not to earth It seemed as if thecelestial city was before us with its gates and walls of sapphire ofemerald of ruby and of gold The waters of life that flow through thecity of God seemed rushing past us for the scene was altogetherunearthly and our feelings were elevated to that sublime architect whocould create such surpassing beauty Earth and its cares home and itsjoys are all forgotten and we feel as if we could ever recline beforethe throne of that mysterious presence and watch untiring those cloudsof incense which are rising before it forever When we left the scenewe trod in solemn silence as if on holy ground The violence with whichthe water pours over the rocks has worn them away58 and the river hasbroken its way up from Lake Ontario at the rate of a rood in threeyears It is supposed when first discovered to have been near theClifton House on the Canadian shore and the ferry house at theAmerican',\n"," 'June 26th—This morning we descended the cliffs by a staircase andcrossed to the Canadian shore The boat was tossed about like a shellupon the whirling waves and as they looked up at the mass of watertumbling so near them and at the boiling water two hundred and fiftyfeet deep under us some of our fellow passengers became a littlenervous My whole soul was so absorbed in contemplating the wondrousscene that I felt no terror A sentinel in the scotch costume greetedour eyes when we landed telling us we were now in a strange land amonganother people A winding walk up the cliff leads you to Clifton Housea celebrated Canadian hotel From the balconies of this house is one ofthe most imposing views of the Niagara falls You see the whole at oncewhile from the American side you see only a part at a time Still ifnot so grand the view is more varied and more beautiful upon theopposite shore and from Iris Island Every one says it is ridiculous toattempt to describe these falls but I have promised to give youdaguerreotype views and will endeavor to sketch the outlines—theshading and the impressions of the scene can only be given by theplace itself Imagine a crescent of water a mile long plunging withawful violence as if the foundations of the great deep had broken upagain from a cliff nearly 200 feet high According to McKenney15000000 tons of water59 are poured over the rocks in 24 hours A greenisland divides this fall into two unequal parts Table rock upon theCanadian shore is at the edge of the falls and projects over the cliffwhere you may stand with nothing between you and the boiling oceanbelow So close is it to the water that the waves wash over part of itand it is almost always covered with mist and spray If it be glory tobe buried in Niagara you may here hope for that fate as a portion ofthe rock has already fallen and a large crack shows you the remainderwill soon follow From this spot is said to be the finest view as theeye embraces the whole circle of waters but as it was one of the dayswhen the mist takes that direction I saw but little of this I foundmyself upon a slippery rock a shelf between heaven and earth withwaves of spray breaking over me and a furious mist dashing into myface—a noise of waters was in my ears a white foam rushed wildly pastand I felt as if caught up in the sky in a whirlwind and driving snowstorm We waded back through the wet grass and ran into the Pavilion toavoid the spray dripping from the eaves This house besides being acuriosity shop is the residence of the guide who will conduct you down along staircase and behind the fall if you wish—as I had no penchantfor being drenched half drowned and suffocated I did not attempt thisexploit We descended this morning the American side and ventured alittle behind that fall One feels very much as an Israelite making hisexode with a wall of water at his side ‘where the flood stoodupright’',\n"," 'When once in you see a glorious chamber with dome and walls of emeraldrendered transparent by60 the morning sun You might imagine yourself inone of those crystal caves where the sea nymphs congregate beneath thearches of the sea On the road from table rock to Clifton House thereis another building where there is a fine museum containing 4000specimens of Indian curiosities animals minerals c many of themfrom that region The trees about here are most of them evergreen Theregular yellow pine grows here and the silver fir with its white linedleaves and purple cones and the fan leaved larch growing 100 feet highThe rocks of Niagara are secondary limestone and sandstone aboundingwith veins and nodules of various minerals—among them selenitecalcareous spar—petrifactions—tufa from the cave and many others Ibelieve I have sketched for you every thing regarding thesefalls—gigantesque phenomene as La Vaseur calls them Still I do notexpect to give you any idea of them for no one who ever wrote conveyedan impression of the reality to me I might make a pyramid ofexpletives and when all the superbs beautiful’s majestic’s andtouching’s are expended you will say when you come ‘the half has neverbeen told me’ Many have been disappointed here chiefly because thescenery around the falls is not as imposing as they had imagined Somewould have a range of lofty mountains as a back scene or a crest ofnaked rocks towering above the falls but I fancy these are of the classof contradictionists who make a respectable figure in conversationmerely by opposing every thing They thus obtain a hearing are able toenter into an argument when no other means would gain them a listenerHe who formed this imposing scene is a better judge61 of the sublime andbeautiful A range of mountains would materially injure the effect asit would by contrast take away from the height of the water Thecataract would be a secondary object but seated as it is in a levelregion of country it is the first object that strikes the eye— a gemon natures forehead There are many drives in this neighborhood tovarious interesting places such as springs whirlpools battlefieldsc The parade ground is also a favorite place of resort A regiment of700 soldiers are reviewed upon the Canadian shore We hired a carriageat the Clifton House and after a short drive found ourselves upon abeautiful plain above the falls surrounded by guard houses andbarracks The plain was soon filled with soldiers who came marching upin separate detachments from every direction They were tall fine formedmen all of one height dressed in the Scotch costume consisting of theshort plaid skirt stockings laced with red cap and a cloud of blackplumes They were well drilled and marched countermarched and wentthrough all their evolutions as one man The dress is picturesque butmust be a cold one in these regions A pantaloon over the naked knee Ithink would be an improvement I could see soldiers although not aswell drilled at home so I was glad to turn my course towards thatrolling flood below From this plain is a fine view of the rapids abovethe cataract and of Iris Island which seems to have floated to thebrink of the precipice like one of the Mexican floating islands Wespent the afternoon upon Iris island In the little curiosity shop werefreshed ourselves with delicate white strawberries grown upon theisland covered62 with rich cream Here also we added to our stock ofIndian bags and moccasins Among the articles in the shops at thevillage I admired most a large living eagle which was chained to hisperch His feathers were black and white and his beak and claws yellowwith a ruff of grey about his neck I pitied the poor captive as hestood gazing sadly out apparently listening to the roar of the fallsand longing to be at large in his native forest once more',\n"," 'The village of Tuscarora Indians is sometimes visited much againsttheir wishes however The Indian nations have never lost the remembranceof their former power and their present degradation They look upon usas usurpers who have wrested from them the land of their fathers andhave never forgiven us They count themselves our prisoners and areindignant that we should come and gaze upon them in their fallen stateas objects of curiosity Their village is built upon the high shore ofNiagara about eight miles below the falls commanding a fine prospect ofthe river and lake They are under the care of a missionary who has beenthe means of converting fifty out of the three hundred This tribe oncebelonged to the confederacy of five nations but came originally fromNorth Carolina and are living upon the proceeds of the sale of theirland there and their trade Some of them are prosperous industriousfarmers while the women embroider beautifully with beads and stainedporcupine quills upon birch bark and deer skin These they dispose ofat the shops and to strangers at the Hotels Upon these occasions I amstruck with the difference between this proud race and our own A pedleror travelling shopman63 comes in unpacks his wares holds up everyarticle insists upon its worth and beauty and urges you to buy—withthe Indian it is otherwise At our hotel while ascending after dinnerto the dining room one is struck by the sight of a row of dark beingssitting upright upon the settees in the halls envelloped in cloaks ofscarlet or black richly embroidered with beads or adorned by pieces oftin cut in flowers and tacked on Their eyes are fixed upon the groundtheir long hair falls over their faces and an expression of profoundmelancholy sits upon every countenance You stand before them and gazeupon them but silent grave and motionless they sit like the band ofconscript fathers awaiting the approach of Attila You at last ask‘Have you any moccasins’ with a dignified motion they throw open theircloaks and their laps are filled with articles for sale You ask theprice—a low musical voice tells you the amount in a very foreignaccent and that is all I could ever obtain from an Indian womanalthough I made many efforts while at Niagara and they can both speakand understand English',\n"," 'I never saw but one of them smile I asked her what she had for sale inher lap—she threw it open and behold a pretty Indian cupid asleep in abirch cradle swathed and bandaged in their peculiar fashion Titaniawould have quarrelled for it At my start of surprise and

havecaused such sorrow The lofty and celestial emotions which are producedwhen in the presence of this one of God’s most beautiful creations youare unwilling to lose You feel ‘it is good to be here’—and you dreadto leave this holy ground to enter again into scenes which will do muchto efface these pure emotions A glimpse of heaven has been vouchsafedyou and most reluctantly you return to earth again Slowly we sat outthis morning to take a last farewell We had seen it in all itsbrightness and we now beheld it in a sombre hue The heavens wereovercast the mist once of a dazzling whiteness now took a dusky tintand hung over the cataract like a mourning veil It was more inaccordance with my feelings than to have bade her adieu while she wassmiling in the ‘bright garish eye of day’—one might fancy she was sadat losing such true worshippers But you cannot understand such feelingsnow they no doubt seem ridiculous—come here and you will experiencethe truth of such emotions At two o’clock soon after dinner we satout on the rail road for Buffalo The road for some time is laid alongthe river bank and gives us a fine view of the islands rapids andother objects of interest as

band have however now dispersed and the island hasreturned to its parent promising never to do so any more It contains7005 acres of good land The river now begins to expand from one mileto eight including Grand Island in the centre This is twelve miles inlength and contains 17384 acres of rich land and stately timber Aneat village called White Haven stands upon its shore containing amongother

beauties of RattlesnakeIsland at our leisure for when just opposite a part of our enginegave way and we came to a sudden pause The male passengers were soonout to discover the cause and came back with a report that we couldproceed no farther as the injury was very great We were declared to be‘in a pretty fix’ A horse was procured from a house in sight and a manwas despatched upon it to Buffalo about eight miles distant Many of thepassengers sat out to walk to Black rock 4 miles a head where theycould66 procure carriages to take them to Buffalo The rest of usremained seated in the coaches with a hot July sun streaming throughthe windows What should we do—scold at the road or the train or theengineers No an American never vexes himself about such things—he iscalm and indifferent under every circumstance Some of us fell toreading some to napping and some to rambling We undertook the latterbut as we were only surrounded by ploughed fields soon returned to thecoach where I busied myself in writing the above Pray read on if it isonly to repay me for my sufferings those two hours in the heat I thinkI had better abuse this rail road a little for it deserves it Do nothowever suppose I am vexed at being left thus ‘sitting on a rail’ Theiron is ripped up in several places causing a jolt when we strikeagainst these land snags and a man rides beside the engineer with ahammer to nail them down It is the worst rail road I ever travelledover however as it is only used a few months in the year when Niagarais fashionable perhaps it may not yield sufficient profit to allow muchexpense upon it Something is seen coming up the road—all heads areout and we hope to be released from our captive state—it turns out tobe the return train which had been waiting for our engine and cars andnow has been obliged to take horses instead As it was impossible topass us the passengers and their baggage were turned out and placed inour coaches to the Niagara end of which their horses were fastenedThey looked very sourly at us while this was passing thinking perhapsof the maxim of Pythagoras to his scholars—Do not remain in thehighway They wondered at us for sitting in67 their highway deprivingthem of their engine and condemning them to the loss of a fineafternoon at Niagara Some of them perhaps might have been of thatwhisking class of tourists who intended to return the

moment of repose in the wearied journey of life to the ‘world’stired denizen’ We felt its benefit and rejoiced no stage horn couldhurry us onward and no bell save the ‘church going bell’ could summonus forth The presbyterian church is a plain building but handsomelyfitted up inside and very comfortable Rev Mr Lord is the ministeran able and pious man We heard in the morning a very interestingdiscourse from Mr Stilwell of the American Bethel Union He deliveredit in a Baptist church in which the Rev Mr Choules officiates when inthe city It is a neat commodious building the pews made of the nativeblack walnut cushioned and lined with horse hair A choir of goodsingers accompanied by instruments led the music The society to whichMr Stilwell belongs devotes itself to the sailor’s interest The stateof the boatmen upon the Erie canal he reported to be very wretchedThere are about 25000 boatmen and sailors employed upon the canal andin lake navigation who were of the lowest and most worthless class ofmen seeming inaccessible to all efforts for their reformation orconversion These mixing with the lower population of Buffalo andother towns on their route exerted a baneful influence The BethelUnion attempted to send missionaries among them but they were abusedinsulted and almost discouraged Still as they felt it their dutythese selfdenying men persevered every Sunday in addressing the menalong the canal and in presenting bibles and tracts They soon beganhowever to have some hope for when the canal closed last autumn therewere only two men who had re69fused tracts and only three who insultedthem With this success small as it was they were excited to go onhoping the Lord was smiling upon their labors The minister mostsuccessful among them had once been a canal boy himself and whilesitting upon his horse dragging the boat employed himself for hours ininventing new and strange oaths to surprise his fellow boatmen The mennow readily listened to him They were conscious of their degradationknew they were despised by all good men and never hoped to rise Seeingnow one of their number so bright and shining a light they trusted aboatman’s name would not always be an object of scorn These poor mencomplained to him that they had no day of rest as there was as muchforwarding upon the Sabbath as upon any other day The Captains of thelake boats were also obliged to struggle against this evil and in someinstances had renounced their trade upon that account or uponremonstrance had been turned adrift for some less scrupulous CaptainThe fault then seems to lie upon the forwarding merchants whom MrStillwell addressed begging their forbearance in this respect',\n"," 'It is to be hoped this address produced its intended effect and themerchants who claim

apier within the shelter of which five large schooners were moored Weobserved a rail road depot ready for the future engines and train—achurch tavern and a few stores Several little boys came on board withpails of cherries for sale which they disposed of at four cents aquart Here we landed a passenger an inhabitant of Dunkirk who duringthe voyage had been vaunting the advantages of his town The day wouldsoon come he said when he should no longer resort to Buffalo for hisgoods as the new rail road would bring all the trade to DunkirkDarkness drove us to our state room which we found replete with everyconvenience—a circumstance much to our satisfaction as we were to spenda week in it ere we reached our destined haven I would recommend you ifyou ever travel this way to choose as we did a state cabin lookingtowards the shore for these boats stop at every considerable town andof course keep near the coast In consequence of this arrangement wecould if inclined sit in our cabin and through the open door or79window behold the scenery at our ease while those upon the oppositeside gazed out upon an uniform waste of waters without a shore I thusobtained a sight of the town of Erie where we stopped during the nightAroused by the noise I looked from my window and saw the towndistinctly by clear starlight This town is in Pennsylvania and is thetermination of the Pittsburg and Erie canal In the canal basin besidecanal boats I saw a large steamboat and several schooners Presque Isledefends the harbor There was a large hotel brightly illuminated andsome stage coaches awaiting the arrival of passengers Erie stands upona high mass of Schistose rock surmounted by a stratum of clay—the wholeforty feet above the lake9 There is said to be here a neat courthouse and several pretty houses surrounded by trees—the streets are atright angles and the trade considerable There was a bridge spanningthe canal which I hoped was the one where the revered La Fayette wasfeted It was formed into a

miles in width Thisis bounded by a ridge of rocks 40 or 50 feet high once according toDarby and Schoolcraft the original boundary of the lake thus givinganother proof that these lakes were once higher than at present theyare This ridge is composed of micaceous limestone and82 schistoserocks covered with farms and groves of beech and oak which attain to alarge size Yesterday afternoon while sailing upon the lake we observedthese hills making a pretty back ground to the towns on the shore—nowit trends too much to the interior to be seen In this ridge arisewaters which flow each way some into lake Erie and others as theMuskingum and Alleghany into the valley of the Ohio This last riverbecoming the Ohio falls into the gulf of Mexico ‘upwards of twelvedegrees of latitude from its source’12 Successive ledges or steppesof sandstone rock lead down to the lake over which the rivers flow inrapids or falls making the scenery in that region very beautiful Wetook in at Cleveland several barrels of flour and nails and Selmasalt and boxes of merchandise—landed several passengers and thenleft this interesting town It must I imagine be a very delightfulplace of residence The Cuyahoga could be

shore adding to the variety of thescene Detroit is a beautiful river connecting lakes St Clair andErie Its width is generally about a mile—opposite Detroit citythreefourths of a mile The shores are very beauti87ful cultivated uponeach side with several pretty islands in the centre Upon the Canadianside we observed several French settlements their windmills upon everypoint giving a novel and unique effect to the scene We did not reachDetroit until ten o’clock although it is only 19 miles from the mouthof the river owing to our delay in taking in wood The city appearedwell covering a plateau of ground elevated 40 feet above the riverThree steamboats were in sight as we approached one being a ferry boatto the town of Sandwich opposite As we were to remain here some timewe landed and walked about the city The city stands upon a plain whichcommands an extensive view of the river and surrounding country A broadstreet runs through the centre called Jefferson avenue lined on eachside with shops and hotels At the upper end are several handsomedwellings surrounded with gardens The churches are common in theirappearance except the catholic which I must say was uncommon It is alarge building of unpainted wood having two odd looking steeplesexactly alike in the centre of the front at the back is a dome havingon each side a belfrey Adjoining this is the residence of the Bishop alarge brick building I was disappointed in the appearance of this cityIt was built by the French you know in 1670 and being so much olderthan Rochester or Buffalo we naturally supposed it would be larger thanit is But the same causes do not operate here which influence theprosperity of the other cities It has not the old and settled state ofNew York behind it nor the great canal Michigan of which Detroit isthe capital has been recently settled and that only in the southernparts The fur trade was for years its88 main dependence and that has oflate fallen off very much As man invades the recesses of the forestthe animals retreat before him Detroit has however felt the wind inher sails and is rapidly following after her southern sisters Of thisthe increase of population is one proof—2222 being their number in1830 and 1839 9278 Several railroads are planned out which whenthe river and lakes are filled with ice will be of much service Ofthese the Detroit and St Joseph are the principal—leading from thiscity across the State to lake Michigan a distance of 194 miles 33miles are completed Many persons take this route to Chicago inpreference to the more extensive one

averaging from 4 to 10 lbs and sometimes weigh 14lbs There is a great trade of this fish upon the lakes 30000 barrelswere exported from Cleveland this season While passing the city whenwe had resumed our voyage we observed several rows of handsome warehouses many of which seemed as if newly erected We also noticed alarge brick building erected for the hydraulic works which supply the89city with

theyoke of the white men Of these a few have appeared in latter yearsBlack Hawk being the last The French he had become accustomed to andsuffered their presence in his realms but when another nation appearedhe determined to root them out the land They were at peace apparentlybut a deceitful peace for Pontiac was organizing a confederacy againstthe English who then occupied Detroit ‘There was no sounding of thetocsin no alarm of war given no motion of the waves were felt’ toquote the words of McKenney—‘In this moment of stillness a scoutreturned bringing the intelligence that a large body of Indians werecrossing lake St Clair in canoes and coming in the direction ofDetroit while numerous bands were appearing at every point’ Pontiacappeared in the neighborhood with 3000 warriors who in a

the water has risen tothe height of five or six feet Our captain pointed to many spots uponthe shore where the water had overflowed the land Upon one prettyplace a farm house had been abandoned and a fine apple orchardstanding two years in the water had been destroyed and now while allaround was green their limbs were bare and leafless A very intelligentman a settler upon the river St Clair

lodge and to see real Indians instead of thosehalf96 civilized beings I had met at Niagara They are a body ofChippeway Indians who reside upon Warpole Island under the care of aMissionary of the Methodist church Their wigwams consisted of polesmeeting at top around which coarse matting formed of reeds isfastened From the apex of these cones smoke was rising telling ofculinary operations going on within Around each lodge was a small patchof potatoes or corn A small church with the missionary cottage and afew log cabins were in the midst Groups of Indians were lounging uponthe bank gazing at us while others unconcernedly pursued their usualoccupations of fishing or hoeing How much more graceful were those wildsons of the forest than the civilized men I had observed upon theshores I had passed Their mantles of cloth or blanket stuff trimmedwith gay colors were gracefully thrown around them and theirornamented leggins or moccasins glittered as they walked How dignifiedis the tread of an Indian we remarked as we passed the island many invarious occupations and attitudes yet they never moved awkwardly norsprang nor jumped in a clumsy manner The missionary cottage was anobject of great interest to us I had often read of these selfdenyingdisciples of Jesus but never before looked upon the scene of theirlabors Here in this lonely shore away from all they love—theirfriends and

sky The lake is two hundred and fiftyfive mileslong and its waters are of a deeper tint than those we have passedowing to its great depth as we are sailing over nine hundred feet ofwater while in some places it is said to be unfathomable The color isa dark olive almost black and it is only when the sun shines throughthe waves that we can perceive they are green The cause of the variouscolors of water has produced many a hypothesis Sir Humphry Davy tellsus the primitive color of water is like the sky a delicate azure13He says ‘the finest water is that which falls from the atmosphere—thiswe can rarely obtain in its pure state as all artificial contact givesmore or less of contamination but in snow melted by the sunbeamsthat has fallen upon glaciers themselves formed from frozen snow maybe regarded as in its state of greatest purity Congelation expels bothsalt and air from water whether existing below or formed in theatmosphere and in the high and uninhabited region of glaciers therecan scarcely be any substances to contaminate Removed from animal andvegetable life they are even above the mineral kingdom’ Water frommelted snow then considered as the purest Sir Humphrey goes on todescribe its color ‘When a mass is seen through it is a bright blueand according to its greater or less depth of substance it has more orless of this color’ ‘In general when examining lakes and masses ofwater in high mountains their101 color is the same bright azure CaptParry states that water in the Polar ice has the like beautiful tint’The brown green and other colors of rivers he imputes to substancesover which they flow as peat bogs vegetable and mineral substances Heallows the sea cannot be colored from any thing upon the bottom butimputes the tint to the infusion of iodine and brome which he hasdetected in sea water the result of decayed marine vegetables Of thisprimitive water are our lakes formed originating as they do in regionsof snow and ice Lake Superior from whence they flow is a vast basinof trap rock of volcanic origin14 It is the most magnificent body ofwater in the world five hundred miles long and nine hundred deep andperfectly pellucid Into this pure and originally azure primitivewater there flow forty rivers upon the south side alone according toMr McKenney of the Indian department who counted this number from StMary’s to the river St Louis These rivers he tells us are all ambercolored Why then may not these yellow rivers flowing into blue waterproduce green You see I like to hazard a hypothesis as well asothers I hope you will not call this absurd Col McKenney himselfimputes the green color to reflection of the ‘rays of light passingthrough the foliage of the shores conveying their own green hue untothe surface of the water from which they are reflected’ This might bethe case in small rivers or lakes but it cannot thus tint such a vastextent of water A writer in the American Journal of Science is ofopinion the color of water is reflected from the sky and is blue dullblack or102 golden as the sky may be—and that ‘green is produced inwater by the yellow light of the sun mixed with the cerulean bluethrough which it shines’ On the contrary the Count Xavier deMaistre15 does not impute the color of water to any infusedsubstance nor to reflection from above but reflection from the surfacebelow ‘as the blue color of the sky is owing to reflection from theearth beneath’ ‘Limpid waters when they have sufficient depth’ saysthe Count reflect like air a blue color from below—and this arisesfrom a mixture of air which water always contains to a greater orlesser amount This blue color being the primitive hue of water issometimes clouded or lost by earthy infusion or reflections from acolored sky The green tinge which he

would be followed by the angerof their Deity One Indian who despised such superstition ventured uponthe shore and was never heard of since The forests and lake in theinterior they imagine is the abode of the blessed after death whosehours will there pass in hunting and fishing The Manitoulin islands inlake Huron are also sacred but they are much larger than these one ofthem being fiftyfive miles in

marsh grasses and waterplants which are seen growing upon it This land when dry was occupiedby the Indians who kindled a fire at the edges of a circle among therushes which drove the animals in the centre where they were caughtThe roots of the prairie grass is not destroyed by fire and ittherefore could not so completely eradicate the roots of those enormoustrees which grow upon the western land

Louis but three or four daysvoyage to New Orleans consequently one may command any thing here Inthree years the Michigan canal will be finished which will open acommunication with the Atlantic through the lakes and the New Yorkcanals Peoria cannot fail of being a place of much business forbesides the above named advantages the land around it is rich prairieinterspersed with wood land or timber as they call it here crossed byseveral mill streams It is but seventy miles from Springfield thecapitol of Illinois a large and handsome town doing a great deal ofbusiness and situated in the celebrated county of Sangamon',\n"," 'Over the level country around Peoria good roads are laid out in everydirection A railroad is in contemplation from hence to the Mississippiat Warsaw while another the Bloomington and Peoria railroad is soonto be laid down from this to the Mackinaw river forty miles It is onthe high road from the gulf of Mexico to the north and alreadytravellers are taking this route to the eastern States We found151 here ayoung lady and her father who had come from Mobile They left there in asteamboat for New Orleans from thence other steamboats brought them upthe Mississippi to Quincy from whence they rode in a stage to PeoriaThey were on their way to New York and had taken this rout from itsnovelty In the afternoon we ramble down to the shores where I foundsome very pretty pieces of agate jasper and other pretty pebbles andgathered several singular shells and flowers The shells wereprincipally large muscle lined with pearl some of them beautifullyirredescent A neat cottage on the bank with its door open looked soinviting that we ventured to enter and ask for a glass of water Thewoman willingly filled a pitcher from a cool spring near and invited usto sit down She looked ill and the children around her were thin andpale I asked her the cause and heard a sad story of fever and aguesickness They had removed from Pennsylvania and had all been ill assoon as they arrived but had hopes of being after a while acclimatedThe cause of their sickness was as usual their exposure to the heavyfogs which arise from this river at night which strangers should avoidfor a year at least—and probably other imprudence Her husband was acarpenter who had sufficient employment where they had lived and therethey were well and happy To my question of the cause of their removalshe answered ‘Oh he had heard of the west where every one is sure toget rich and so he came’ Most of the emigrants we have met with couldgive us no better reason for removing hither than this woman They hearthe west spoken of as a great rich and rising country152 pull up theirhousehold by the roots and ‘westward hold their way’ I believe no onebut our people can thus readily leave their homes and the graves oftheir fathers to seek a residence in new and untried regions Among theemigrants we were often surprised to see so many from the neighboringStates Hoffman met a man during his ‘winter in the west’ who hadremoved his household from one end of the State of Michigan to theother merely because the mould was a foot richer at Kalamazoo—his ownbeing eighteen inches A man removes from the eastern border to the westof Pennsylvania Perhaps he there erects a house and in a few years seesa good farm around him another wishing to remove west offers him a sumfor it so much larger than his original outlay that he is tempted tosell and emigrate farther west He with this money purchases a place ofa man in Ohio who sells in the same way and passes on In a few yearsthe Pensylvanian again sells and again removes so that there is aconstant stream going step by step to fill up the immense plains andvalleys which here abound Fashions for emigration prevail a placebecomes popular every one is excited by the accounts of this newDorado and westward ho is the cry Boon’s Lick in Missouri Saltriver Platte river Oregon Rock river Wisconsin Michigan and Iowaeach have had its run and its partisans But there is ‘more than meetsthe ear’ in this fortunately their destinies are not left to theguidance of their own variable fancies There is an overruling Power atwhose command their steps are hither bent When I see them on theirmarch people from every nation men women and little ones and cattlewinding down153 the road in their wagons filling the steamboats andcrowding the stages all pressing in large bodies towards the land ofmilk and honey they remind me of the Hebrews plucked up from anovergrown country and led with an Almighty hand to the land ofpromise May these travellers study the eventful journey of thePalestine emigrants and shun those errors by which they were drivenforth from its fair fields The Hebrews were told if they would obeytheir heavenly leader ‘the land shall yield her increase and the treesof the field shall yield their fruit’—and ‘ye shall eat your bread tothe full and dwell in the land safely’ and ‘ye shall lie down and noneshall make you afraid’ ‘I will be your God and ye shall be mypeople’17 What magnificent promises And how powerful the promiserOh that these people would lay these words to their heart and considerwell the Hebrew’s fate They were also promised to be made ‘high aboveall nations which He hath made in praise in name and in honor’18There be those who predict this for our country let these read theconditions by which this maybe obtained and dread curses19 whichawait a failure We continued our stroll back of the town across theprairie or steppe upon which it is built to another about twelve orfifteen feet above it From thence is a fine plateau which reaches tothe bluffs As we sat upon this eminence the view was very pretty Thesun had been long gone but a delicate amber shaded with purple tintedevery thing Below us was the green prairie crossed with dark purplepaths over which the ‘lowing herds’ were winding slowly as if loth toleave their free pastures154 for the confinement of a barn yard Thecattle raised upon prairie grass are very fat and the Illinois beefcommands a ready sale in the New Orleans markets The butter and milk wemet with here was uncommonly rich equal to our first rate Goshenbutter Beyond the prairie is the town beneath which flows the quietIllinois bounded by dark forests and elevated bluffs While we werethus sitting enjoying the ‘coming on of grateful evening mild’ the deepsilence was broken by the sweet sound of a church bell echoing over theriver and the still forests At once these words of Milton so veryappropriate to our situation sprang to our lips',\n"," 'There was apparently an evening meeting about to be held and werejoiced we should be enabled to enter the courts of the Lord aprivilege we had been denied for some time Our path to the town laypast several very pretty cottage residences ornamented with shrubberyand flowers—thence following the sound of the bell we found ourselvesbefore a small meeting house It happened fortunately to be the meetingwhich enjoyed the administration of the Rev Mr S——g of thepresbyterian persuasion whom we found to be a very pleasingintelligent and pious man We were very much gratified with hisdiscourse which we found very appropriate He spoke of man as atraveller the end of whose journey must certainly one day approach andearnestly bade us to take thought for that event as there were manythere who ‘before the frost is spread over our prairie may155 be lyingunder its sod’ He reminded us much of Amos the herdsman of Tekoa forhis similies were all drawn from rural objects—the sun the clouds theprairie the river and the scenery around him We no longer wondered atthe accounts we had received of the high religious and moral standing ofthe place and the great amount of good done in it This last yeartwentythree thousand dollars were contributed by the people of Peoriatowards charitable and religious institutions We walked home under abright moon our hearts much refreshed by all we had heard and we wererejoiced the Lord had placed such a faithful servant in these fairprairies to uphold his name',\n"," 'July 9th—While wandering along the shore this morning we descriedthe smoke of our expected steamboat and hastened back to the hotel topack our trunks It was the Home from Peru to St Louis and we were totake passage in her for Alton on the Mississippi We bade adieu tosweet Peoria with regret The remembrance of it will long ‘perfume ourminds’ as old Izaak Walton says Its situation its excellent societyand religious privileges and its good schools must certainly make it adesirable place of residence or of trade It is two hundred miles fromSt Louis and one hundred and seventy from Chicago When in the saloonof the Home we were presented with a book in which to write our namesplace of residence whither bound and our politics While leavingthis our eyes fell upon a piece of pink satin framed which hungagainst the wall upon which was printed the rules of the boat Amongother things it forbid ‘any gentleman to go to table without his156 coator any other garb to disturb the company No gentleman must pencilworkor otherwise injure the furniture’ I suppose whittling was meant Uponour lake boat we saw the boxes of merchandize and barrels on deck fastdisappearing under the whittling knife A piece a foot long and twoinches wide would be torn from the box and cut to pieces by a restlesspassenger Beside these we were told ‘no gentleman was to lie down ina berth with his boots on and none enter the ladies’ saloon withoutpermission from them’ We found in this boat three indications of beingnear the south liquors upon the table gambling in the gentlemen’scabin and a black chambermaid slave to the captain Among thepassengers were a man with his wife and sons unlike the most I hadmet going west but making a retrograde motion to the east They weredriven away they said by the fever and ague from which they had beensuffering ever since their removal west Their yellow gaunt appearancefully testified to the truth of this He had been a shop keeper in theState of New York who experiencing some reverses was persuaded toremove to this golden region by his wife who was now no longer able tolead the village fashions He bought a lot and mill privilege in anembryo town—their house was situated under the boughs of a forestimpenetrable to the sunbeams surrounded by decaying leaves moist newsoil and a mill pond The town’s people were too busily occupied inbuilding banks and hotels to dig wells and drinking out of the marshysprings of course all fell ill by turns Their boy they said had beenat ‘death’s door’ and now although better was afflicted with an aguecake which they wished me157 to feel in his side I am convinced alittle prudence and knowledge will keep many ‘healthy wealthy andwise’ who without it are easily discouraged fall into difficultiesand wish to try a new place We have met many upon the road who havenearly equalled the old woman on the prairie who had begun the worldseven times',\n"," 'The other female passenger was a young girl who had come down the riverin the boat her home being on the prairie back of Peru She was apretty innocent country lassie about sixteen travelling alone on avisit to a brother living on the river whose wife was ill and requiredher services Her travelling dress was a muslin striped with pink andher hat one of that description we call Dutch bonnets made ofpasteboard covered with pink glazed gingham She was rejoiced to examinemy wardrobe and cut new patterns as she lives far from the haunts ofmen and mantuamakers My Mosaic brooch pleased her much and she askedme if I had bought it of the pedlar who she heard had lately arrived inthat part of the country with a lot of new goods and whom she was eagerto see I was obliged to say I had not purchased it from thatfashionable depositary She then proposed to show me her clothes minebeing new to her she supposed her’s must be new and desirable to me Ather request the chambermaid drew from the stateroom a huge chest ofblack walnut which she opened and among other things displayed apretty straw bonnet trimmed with gay ribbons and flowers That was herSunday bonnet She also drew forth a topaz pin which had reached here ina pedlar’s cart and was a present to her by her brother ‘This pin haslasted158 wonderfully’ she said ‘considering how much it has beenborrowed At every dance or party when I do not go some of the girlsborrow and wear it It has been lent for ten miles around’ This younglady had been brought when quite young by her family from Ohio whencethey emigrated here They had all suffered much from the fever and aguebut were now acclimated or rather had corrected the causes of theiragues and she had become fat and rosy I have remarked in severalinstances that the children born here or brought here young grow upstrong and ruddy and their parents suffer the most It is only thefirst generation who lose their health as the land improves anddiseases vanish about their homes by the time their children are grownThis family live upon a large and productive farm which yields amongother things according to her account four hundred bushels of peachesIn the season of this delicious fruit her mother gives a peach feastinviting all their friends and acquaintances who after eating as muchas they like carry away each a basket full Her family sell severalbarrels of dried peaches every year',\n"," 'Twelve miles below Peoria we stopped at the town of Pekin built upon abank elevated fifteen feet above the water during high tide but nowall these places are much higher The captain told us he should be heresome time taking in merchandize and we employed the interval in seeingthe lions of the town I told the little country girl our intention‘Lions’ she said ‘I guess you mean wolves there are no lions in theseparts’',\n"," 'Pekin is a small place and only contains eight or159 nine hundredinhabitants and five or six streets The shops seemed well filled withgoods and presented a goodly show of tin ironware drygoodscrockery provisions etc I purchased a green gauze veil here andseveral small articles all of which I found much more expensive than inour Atlantic shops freight being high on the Mississippi In paying forthem I found a new currency here my shillings and sixpences beingtransformed into bits and pics or picayunes The Pekin Express layupon the counter which we amused ourselves looking over while waitingfor change The person who kept the shop turned out to be the oldestinhabitant of the place that important personage who in a stormalways determines if there has been ever a greater one or no He mightvery well be the oldest as the town is but ten years in existence‘Pekin’ he said ‘would have been ere this far ahead of any town uponthe river were it not that there were two parties among thecommissioners who were to lay it out these pulling different ways thetown was nearly lost between them The rich country behind and theriver in front had befriended them and they soon expected to havetheir branch of the railroad finished to Mackinaw river whose waterpower and timber bluffs were very valuable’ We remarked as we walked alarge hotel nearly finished a presbyterian methodist and severalother meetinghouses office of the ‘Tazewell Telegraph’ academy andsome dwellings We lay here four hours with a hot sun reflecting fromthe sandy bank impatiently watching the barrels of flour which seemedas they would never cease rolling from the large storehouse upon thebank down to our vessel These barrels are160 from the steam flour millswhich turn out two hundred barrels a day Beside these we took in ahundred sacks of corn and some other merchandize The captain seemedwell pleased with his morning’s work saying he had a streak of luckthat day Three miles below this he had another ‘streak’ At the mouthof Mackinaw river scows were waiting him loaded with bundles of lathsand staves and long dark boards which I took for mahogany but whichproved to be blackwalnut The Mackinaw is a clear stream having richbottom land bounded by bluffs covered with white oak and cedar

with its sweet resting place and at thesilent admiration of those stately trees which were sending their coolflickering shadows over her and gazing down at loveliness that it wouldfain linger upon its course as some young languid beauty conscious ofa graceful position which is winning admiring glances from everybeholder',\n"," 'Among the trees beside the usual elm oak and maple we observedseveral enormous wild cherry trees nearly one hundred feet in heightand at least fifteen feet in circumference and the paw paw the coffeenut the red ash American nettle a tall slender tree with pretty redberries and many unknown to us or to those around us The islands inthis river are small but covered with soft luxurious herbage The birdsand wild fowl were out enjoying themselves chattering pluming theirwings and visiting each161 other from tree to tree Among the wild fowlwe observed teal and brant and wild ducks skimming over the water orwheeling in flocks over our heads One apparently in a spirit ofdaring would set out to cross our path—leaving his little cove hewould glide with the utmost rapidity over the river in front of usleaving a silver line on the smooth surface of the stream and after wehad passed glide back bobbing up and down upon the waves in our wakeWhen he arrived at home what a quacking and chattering and flutteringwas heard In one little cove or bayou was a little island coveredwith rich grass and shaded from the sun by the dense grove whosebranches met over it—this seemed to be quite a colony of ducks whowere going and coming in rapid but graceful evolutions from the mainland A young man who stood near us named the place Quackville anddeclared when he returned home he would publish a map and sell off thelots We passed several towns to day as

short moonlight walk we reached TheEagle tavern a favorite name for hotels I think in our country was acomfortable house although not pretending to the style and fashion ofthe Alton House And now having finished these last few lines while oursupper was preparing I hasten to bid you goodnight175',\n"," 'Alton July 11th',\n"," 'My dear E—Harassed by no compunctious visitings for the enormouspackage which I dismissed to you this morning through the Altonpostoffice I have seated myself deliberately before my little desk toprepare you another We have spent a delightful day among our friendshere and are very much pleased with the towns of Alton for there aretwo of them We are now four o’clock waiting for the steamboat to takeus to St Louis and I employ the time in making a few sketches of theplace for you Alton is built as I told you upon a sloping bank Thisground is very uneven and upon some of the elevated portions are thepublic buildings The churches here are well built and numerous I thinkseven or eight the streets wide and airy places reserved for publicsquares and several handsome private dwellings The town has arisenrapidly and from a small town in 1832 it has now fine streets andhouses two hundred being built last year merchants who transactbusiness to176 the amount of several hundred thousand dollars and evenhalf a million in some instances Eight or ten steamboats are ownedhere and two railroads in contemplation and the great national road itis thought will be conducted through this place There are severalreligious societies here each having houses of worship among them thebaptist church is spoken of as being nicely fitted up in the interiorit is built of stone Every convenience and comfort of life is at handcoal in profusion in the vicinity of the town which is sold very cheaplimestone freestone and water lime besides other mineral productionsabound The markets are stored with wild game—deer partridges prairiehen and waterfowl fruits both wild and cultivated various sorts offish corn beef pork and vegetables of the finest order Madisoncounty in which it stands is one of the richest in the State beingmost of it upon the American bottom It contains seven hundred andninety square miles and the value of its productions exclusive ofcapital invested and cost of buildings amounts to two millions threehundred and sixtynine thousand one hundred and fiftyone dollars andeighty cents Of bushels of wheat they have raised one hundred andsixtyfive thousand five hundred and twenty Corn one million threehundred and four thousand three hundred and thirtyfive bushelsTobacco eleven thousand two hundred and eighty pounds Capital investedin manufactures two hundred and ten thousand four hundred andthirtyfive dollars But I suppose you do not care for these details IfI should come here again in a few years I expect to see Alton threetimes its size for although it may not rival St Louis as theinha177bitants imagine it must be the most considerable place after itwest of Cincinnati The Illinois brings to it the produce of thenorthern lakes and States—the Mississippi waft to its doors the exportsof the west and takes it over to the Ohio and to the gulf of Mexicofrom which last it is only four or five days distant The interests ofreligion and education employ the benevolent inhabitants to a remarkabledegree and many thousands are expended every year for the furtherance ofthese objects Among these are Shurtliff College Alton TheologicalSeminary Alton Female Seminary But enough of statistics you will sayand I hasten to our own personal adventures We ordered a carriagetoday to take us to Upper Alton to visit our friends there and werequite pleased to see as nice a coach and pair of horses as we could seein our own Broadway After leaving the town we drove through some richprairie land interspersed with trees through which we obtained fineviews of the swift rolling Mississippi and across it the verdant plainsof Missouri with green swelling hills beyond A drive of two milesbrought us to Upper Alton a pretty small looking village with spiresand neat dwellings peeping through the trees This place is verypleasantly situated upon an elevated plateau of ground about two milesfrom the lower town Families here enjoy great advantages in regard tothe education of their children as colleges and schools abound in itsneighborhood The society of this place is very superior and itssituation healthy',\n"," 'We found our friends in a large picturesque house in the cottage stylesurrounded by piazzas whose pillars were wreathed with the clusteringMichigan178 rose and shaded by the graceful cotton wood and pretty redbud and locust Here indeed was a western paradise upon the Mississippibanks we found realized those visions so many have sighed after alodge in the vast wilderness a secluded retreat from the haunts of menwhere the confusions and follies of the world are only remembered as atroubled dream A charming young family and a well selected libraryrender this retirement most delightful A seminary upon a new plan hadbeen lately erected near their abode and with a view of showing usevery thing of interest around them our friends drove us in theircarriage through a pleasant road in an oak forest to the MonticelloFemale Seminary The building is of limestone of that region fourstories in height It stands within a lawn ornamented with groups oftrees and a fine garden is laid out in the rear This extensiveestablishment was founded by Benjamin Godfrey Esq a gentleman ofAlton who to this benevolent purpose devoted a large share of hisproperty While a resident of the west many examples had come beforehis eyes of the miseries arising from the imperfect education of theyoung women who settle here The dearth of servants rendered itnecessary for the young wives around him to superintend if not assistin household labor and he saw how much better it was they should comeprepared for these duties and quite able to perform them instead ofwearing themselves out and pining away over tasks which by being newappear much more arduous than they are in reality As the evil lay in adefective system of education this generous individual at once saw howgreat a desideratum an institution would be uniting useful withornamental179 accomplishments With a public spirit to be much applaudedMr Godfrey erected this spacious building for educating ‘wives for thewest’ Eighty young ladies is the limited number all to be overfourteen years of age With the course of scientific study usual infemale seminaries the pupils are taught music instructed in religionand in various household duties Among other lessons they are taughtto set a table arrange their rooms even sweep and scrub them washstarch and iron all their clothes Some young ladies who had been bredin idleness or who had come from the indulgent homes of Alton orluxurious mansions of St Louis where slaves await their nod were veryreluctant at first to undertake these menial employments but theadvantage which so good a school presented in its other departmentsrendered their mothers deaf to their complaints They were soonhowever broken in and sing as merrily over their wash tubs as theother pupils As gain is not the object of its generous founder theprice of admission is placed low still there are some whose means aretoo straightened for even this and these are allowed to pay for theirinstruction by labor in the house The eagerness to get admittance foryoung persons is very great and many thus receive instruction who areof high respectability and are enabled to attend to the youngerbranches of the family or even if required teach others Some ofthese young persons are beneficiaries of a benevolent society calledthe ‘Ladies’ Association for Educating Females’ The object of thissociety is to ‘encourage and assist young females to qualify themselvesfor teaching and to aid in supporting teachers in those places180 wherethey cannot otherwise be sustained’ Young females of all ages areselected from poor families and placed in schools where they arewatched over by these benevolent ladies their tuition paid and toeach every year is addressed a circular letter of advice with thedonation of an appropriate instructive book When prepared they areplaced in situations where they can support themselves Several havebecome missionaries and at this school are two of the Cherokee tribewho are preparing to be teachers among their people The great amount ofgood performed by these ladies entitle them to the hearty wishes of thebenevolent and patriotic The Rev J Spalding in his address beforethe seventh annual meeting at Jacksonville says ‘Since itscommencement it has aided one hundred and fortyseven young ladies intheir preparation for usefulness and heaven thirtyone of whom areprofessed followers of the Lamb’ Now that I have thoroughly describedthe institution we will leave the carriage and enter the house We wereshown into a neatly furnished parlor where we were soon joined by theprincipal of Monticello the Rev Theron Baldwin a gentleman of greatinformation and piety He kindly explained to us the principle uponwhich the seminary was conducted and then offered to show us the houseEvery thing was arranged with the greatest order and neatness Thedining school and recitation rooms were large clean and airy andthe bed rooms commodious Upon the ground floor was a chapel fitted upwith the beautiful black walnut of their woods here divine service isperformed by the Rev Mr Baldwin to the school and people of theneighborhood who assemble181 there every Sunday You see the Illinoispeople are determined their people shall enjoy the blessings ofeducation and when we reflect how much the destiny of our nationdepends upon the next generation we cannot devote our time or our moneyto a better purpose than furthering such institutions We left theseminary pleased with its arrangements and wishing all success to thegenerous individual who originated the establishment It is delightfulto see wealth so well employed to behold the ‘just steward’ thus ablydisposing of his master’s property Such disinterestedness shone out inbold relief from the selfish and reckless waste of fortune which we hadbeheld in our pilgrimage like one of his own ‘oak islands’ upon asunny and treeless prairie',\n"," 'Once more we experienced the pains of parting and were forced to leaveour friends that afternoon We returned to our hotel where we areawaiting the arrival of our steamboat which is to take us to St LouisWhen I look around in this interesting country and upon such towns asAlton I wonder why our Atlantic cities are so full of people How manyyoung men do I know there and

twentyfive miles Alton looked verypretty when we turned to bid a sorrowful adieu and we regretted ourtime would not allow us to remain in this interesting place We are nowall eagerly looking out for the giant Missouri whose junction with theMississippi is but two miles below Alton At length the point is inview all gather upon the guards and bend our eyes towards the rightshore—we are now before the mouth and behold an extraordinary sceneThe Missouri does not as travellers tell us come rushing andbounding and dashing along striking the Mississippi with such aconcussion that volumes of mist arise in the air—we beheld nothing sowonderful—a broad stream rolled down between its verdant banksrapidly and very like a torrent but in quite a decent and propermanner Its color—alas for our pellucid lakes—is a tint not oftenrecognized by artists but generally called gruel or soapsuds hue Itholds in solution such an extraordinary quantity of clay that onewonders how the steamboat can force its way through it Its rapidcurrent is distinguished by the curls and little whirlpools among themud Where it meets the Mississippi is a small ridge of clay and thickmasses push themselves under the clear brown water coloring it more andmore with its impurity until at last the unhappy Mississippi afterstruggling for some time is completely lost in the clayey stream assome pure young heart striving against temptation but lost at lastThe streams continue separate for some miles below St Louis and therethe river takes the Missouri character I looked up183 the vista of thisgrand stream as we passed its mouth with sentiments of awe A mightymass of water—it came rolling down nearly four thousand miles from itssource in the wild recesses of the Rocky Mountains bearing upon itsbosom not a fleet of Argosies but materials for their construction inwhole forests of gigantic trees',\n"," 'Such an admirer of water as you know I am you may be sure I regrettedthe soiling of my bright brunette

the water is very much like Albany as it is builtupon rising ground consisting of two plateaus of land the lastelevated several feet above the other but its water craft gave it quitea different character We are used in our cities to behold the waterfront bristling with masts but here we saw steamboats alone therebeing about seventy moored at the wharves which gave a novel andwestern appearance to the scene184 The flat boat is fast disappearingand steamboats are the only style of boat with few exceptions whichwe see of these five hundred and eightyeight have been built upon thewestern waters21 The city of St Louis stretches a mile along theelevated shore and nearly the same distance back We almost fanciedourselves in New York again so great was the stir upon the wharf Thewarehouses of brick or limestone made of the rock upon which theystand appeared filled with goods and customers boxes and bales cartsand barrows were floating about and every one seemed active except thenegro slaves who were plodding about their work with the usualnonchalant gait of this merry but indolent nation We missed our goodwharves at home and even the paved bank of Alton for a shower hadrendered the shore muddy Surely some Yankee might contrive a morecommodious landing something that might rise and fall with the riveror a long pier We drove to the Missouri House where we arrived in timefor tea and at night were lulled to sleep by a Spanish guitar andchattering of French voices from the shops and cafes in ourneighborhood185',\n"," 'St Louis July 12',\n"," 'My dear E—The days we have spent here we have been very busyexcept Sunday in examining every thing in and about this place It is avery nice city and one of much importance has increased much latelyand will continue to increase Its population is twentyfour thousandfive hundred and fiftyfive In 1825 it was only six thousand There areseveral good churches here some of which we attended today it beingSunday There is a pretty episcopal of the Gothic form a baptistchurch of brick having a neat white porch in front—an unitarian ofplaster—a methodist and a large cathedral belonging to the catholicsThis is an odd picturesque building and is one hundred and thirtysixfeet by eightyfour broad built of grey stone You enter by a porchsupported by four Doric columns The body of the church is divided bycolumns lighted by elegant chandaliers the sacristy and altar are veryhandsome the windows of painted glass and there is in the church afine186 painting of St Louis presented by Louis XVIII The bells arefrom

whirled upon thestream of life our attention occupied in avoiding the snags and sawyersand cross currents in our channel how refreshing how necessary is itfor us to anchor for a little while and look about and consider ourfuture course The Sabbath is a precious anchor to the soul giving ittime to meditate upon its future career and consult those charts whicha kind heaven has sent to direct its route The Sabbath is necessary toman and was given in mercy Physicians tell us rest is required for themachinery of man that the brain and nerves while forever upon thestretch will decay much sooner than if sometimes relaxed It was theopinion of the great Wilberforce that the suicide of Lord Londonderryand that of Sir Samuel Romilly was owing to their neglect of this day ofrest Speaking of the death of the former he says ‘he was certainlyderanged—the effect probably of continued wear and tear of the mindBut the strong impression of my mind is that it is the effect of thenonobservance of the Sabbath both as abstracting from politics fromthe continual recurrence of the same reflections and as correcting thefalse views of worldly things and bringing them down to their ownindistinctness He really was the last man in the world who appearedlikely to be carried away into the commission of such an act so coolso self possessed It is very curious187 to hear the newspapers speakingof incessant application to business forgetting that by a weeklyadmission of a day of rest which our Maker has graciously enjoined ourfaculties would be preserved from the effects of this constant strain Iam strongly impressed with the recollection of your endeavors to prevailupon the lawyers to give up Sunday consultations in which poor Romillywould not concur If he had suffered his mind to enjoy such occasionalrelaxations it is highly probable the strings would never have snappedas they did from over extension’',\n"," 'July 13th—This morning we took a coach and drove about to everything worth seeing in the city In the French part of the town thestreets are narrow and present quite a foreign and antique appearanceHere are several neat whitewashed steep roofed dwellings surrounded bypiazzas and occupied by the French part of the community Main streetwhich corresponds with our Pearl street runs parallel with the riverabout a mile It appears a very busy street and here one may obtaingoods from all quarters of the world brought up from New Orleans—anddomestic wares from the country around As you ascend from the river thestreets are wider and better built and the upper end of the city islaid out in wide streets fast filling up with handsome buildings publicand private some of these last surrounded by courts and adorned bytrees Here many eastern people dwell A gentleman of the place told usthere had been nine hundred houses put up in the city this year andfrom appearances I should think this a true estimate There is a medicalcollege in progress and a large hotel188 nearly finished which is saidto be the largest hotel in the States It is of red brick ornamentedwith white marble and is altogether a handsome building It is to becalled the ‘St Louis House’ Several institutions are conducted bycatholics as the Convent of the Sacred Heart and the University of StLouis In the library of the latter are nearly seven thousand volumesThe court house is of brick with a circular portico supported by whitecolumns It stands in a large court in the centre of the city surroundedby an iron railing We entered the hall and ascending to the cupolabeheld a very delightful scene The city is laid out as in a map belowus—behind stretch the verdant prairies in front the swift rollingMississippi and beyond it the rich fields of the American bottoms inIllinois and the white buildings of Illinois town opposite Whileleaving the court house we were attracted by some advertisements uponthe door for the sale of slaves We noticed one for the sale of‘Theresa a likely negro girl about twelve years of age’ This was ourfirst intimation we were in a land of slavery You must not expect adissertation upon slavery for whatever my opinions are I shall keepthem to myself as I cannot mend or alter the state of things by myadvise nor is it a woman’s province to meddle in such high matters ofState However I might think I certainly shall never speak in publicupon the subject as I have a good old friend called St Paul and hein one of his letters says ‘It is a shame for a woman to speak inpublic’ and ‘women should be keepers at home’ It is true I am not akeeper at home just now but I am travelling for health and not toenlighten the people with my wisdom The num189ber of slaves in Missouriis forty eight thousand nine hundred and fortyone—its entirepopulation is five hundred thousand We visited a museum herecelebrated for its collection of organic remains and we were surprisedat the number and good preservation of these ‘medals of creation’ Theowner and keeper of this museum is Mr Koch a man of great enthusiasmupon the subject of paleantology He had just returned from anexpedition to the interior of Missouri from whence he had procuredninety weight of bones Seeing our interest in these things he admittedus into an interior room which had the appearance of a charnel housefilled with bones and skeletons which his servant was covering withpreparation to preserve them from the effects of the air Among themwere gigantic remains of the mastodon and other huge animals with teethin excellent preservation This museum contained many well preservedspecimens the most important of all was a huge animal with tusks whichhe called missourium He found also a head of an unknown animal which iscertainly the largest quadruped whose remains have been discoveredhaving two horns each ten feet long extending out horizontally on eachside making with the head a length of twentyfive feet from the tip ofone tusk to that of the other The missourium so called from the Statein which it was found was an animal much larger than the elephanthaving tusks measuring four and a half feet in length and one and ahalf in circumference near the head These animals with theantediluvial reindeer and horse of a large size and myriads of brokenbones were found by Mr Koch last May near the sulphur springs atLittle190 Rock creek twentytwo miles south of St Louis They were in avalley surrounded by high cliffs this great deposit of bones forming an‘osseous brescia such as is found upon the east coast of theMediterranean sea’ ‘The lower strata upon whose surface these boneswere deposited’ says Mr Koch in his written description which he gaveus ‘consists of a bluish sand resembling that which is often found uponthe bottom of the Mississippi’ These bones were cemented in a layer ofgravel one and a half feet in thickness The cement is calcareous of ayellow grey color containing saltpeter It combines the bones andgravel together so that it is with the greatest difficulty they can beseparated this layer is covered with a crust of chrystalization Thenext strata is composed of small pieces of rock and bones broken andin some instances ground to powder these rocks are limestone some ofthem weighing several tons The next strata is blue clay from two tofour feet in thickness containing few bones this clay is covered withbroken rocks again above which is the soil covered with trees Thewhole mass makes a hill sloping down from the rocky bluff of thirty orforty feet to the creek Mr Koch is of opinion these animals herdedtogether and sought shelter under these cliffs during some greatconvulsion of nature and here met their death by being crushed bycrumbling rocks and covered with debris Here we saw also the remainsof that animal which I mentioned in one of my former letters as havingbeen killed by human hands Beneath it had been built a fire of woodand around it were Indian axes and large pieces of stone which had beenthrown at it191 as if for the purpose of killing it The animal hadevidently been mired and killed by the inhabitants This is a discoveryof great importance proving the mastodon according to Indiantradition had lived since the deluge He showed us the elephant fishor spoonbill taken from a lake in Illinois which was saturated withoil although it had been cleaned and dried several years also somelive specimens of prairie animals—the wolverine the prairie wolf andthe marmot or prairie dog a small grey animal famous for dwelling inthe same nest with the prairie owl You have heard of this prairie dogwhose villages extend over many acres in the prairies they burrow underthe ground having over the entrance to their hole a small mound abouttwo feet high and eighteen inches wide Charles Lucien Bonaparte says ofthem ‘It is a very odd circumstance that this owl and dog should sharethe same habitation but so it is and they present an example of unitywhich is quite pleasing’ Another striking feature in the case of theseanimals is they make the same cry cheh cheh pronounced severaltimes in rapid succession',\n"," 'In the afternoon we strolled out to the suburbs of the town to see theIndian mounds several of which are grouped together near the riverbank in the environs of the city One of them is enclosed within thegrounds of General Ashley an ornament as rare as it is beautiful Uponanother is built the city waterworks Upon one about twenty feet higha truncated cone covered with soft grass we seated ourselves enjoyingthe silence and watching the Mississippi’s flood rolling below uswhile we mused upon the fate and fortunes of these ancient ‘moundbuilders’ The192 thermometer had stood at ninetysix all day and we wereglad to escape the heat and dust of the city The sun had disappearedbut had left a soft amber radiance upon shore and river and a purplehaze upon the tops of the distant bluffs of Illinois While gazing uponthese monuments and looking at the relics of a lost race which theycontain we try in vain to pierce the mists of time and answer the ‘whowere they’ which we ask ourselves The vast valley between theAlleghany mountains and the Rocky or Chippewayan chain is studded withthese antique mounds from three feet to two hundred feet in heightThey are generally in the form of a parallelogram except in thenorthwest where they take the shape of a cone and by a late discoveryin Wisconsin they are seen taking the figure of men and animals Thereis a human effigy which is one hundred and twentyfive feet long theothers are rude resemblances to the buffalo birds alligator etcthese are all lying down upon the surface of the earth Our Indiantribes each take the name of an animal as fox beaver buffalo etcwhich custom might have also prevailed with the effigy builders Thereare several grouped together here around the one upon which we aresitting and several upon the Illinois shore opposite These lastconsist of small ones surrounding a larger one which has acircumference of six hundred yards at the base and is ninety feet inheight half way down the side is a step or platform cut into the hillabout fifteen feet wide It is called Monk’s hill from the circumstanceof its having been the residence of some monks of La Trappe who duringthe troubles of the revolution fled to this country and built a houseupon this193 mound Here they kept a garden and supported themselvesselling its produce at St Louis and by repairing clocks and watchesTheir penances were very severe What an illustration of Shakspeare‘patience on a monument’ were these old men while meditating upon atumulus in a howling wilderness In vain we puzzle our brain as to thecause of these structures and ask are they erected for mausoleumswatch towers or temples Those which have been opened contain humanremains ancient pottery instruments of war and are evidently placesof sepulchre Some of them contain rude earthen vases which had beenfilled with food for the use of the deceased In vases discovered in anIndian sepulchre near Steubenville upon the Mingo Bottom were bonesof turkies oppossums c which had been placed there that theirfriends might not want food upon their journey to the land of spiritsStone pipes are also found cut out of their sacred red clay of StPeters or steatite greenstone and limestone some bearing resemblancesto eagle’s or other bird’s heads Arrow heads of flint or quartz arealso found with the former article with idols silver and copper ringsand rosaries You have heard I suppose of the circle of mounds aroundwhich is built the town of Circleville upon the Scioto river of OhioHere was an ancient city enclosed by a double wall of earth with aditch between the walls The walls and ditch occupy nearly seventy feetwhich gives thirty feet as the base of each wall and ten for the widthof the ditch This circular town or it may be fortification was threehundred and fifty yards across A square fort is near this the walls ofwhich were twenty feet wide without194 any ditch The fort is threehundred yards across and is an exact square The present town is laidout on these ancient and venerable works the court house built in theform of an octagon stands in the centre of the circular fort andoccupies the spot once covered by a large and beautiful mound but whichwas levelled to make room for the building This forms the nucleusaround which runs a circular street with a spacious common betweenthe court house and street on this street the principal taverns andstores are erected and most of the business done Four other streetsrun out of the circle like radii from a centre On the south side ofthis circle stands a conical hill crowned with an artificial mound astreet has lately been opened across the mound and in removing theearth many skeletons were found in good preservation A cranium of oneof them was in my possession and is a noble specimen of the race whichonce occupied these ancient walls It has a high forehead large andbold features with all the phrenological marks of daring and braveryPoor fellow he died overwhelmed by numbers as the fracture of theright parietal bone by a battleaxe and five large stone arrowssticking in and about his bones still bear testimony22',\n"," 'We must regret the destruction of these mounds but in consideration ofthose which are allowed to remain undisturbed and of the taste andfancy displayed by the citizens of Circleville in laying out their townamong them we may forgive them There is an ancient fortification nearthe junction of the195 river Wisconsin with the Mississippi in the anglesof which mounds are erected Upon the plantation of Walter Irvin Esqabout ten miles from Natchez and seven from the Mississippi is anothervery singular group of fortifications and tumuli If you desire myopinion I should decidedly say they were erected over the slain inbattle Sometimes they contain but one body perhaps of some greatchieftain whom the enemy’s archers have stricken others are erectedover several bodies laid in layers who as fast as they have fallenhave been laid upon the mound the earth placed over them to receiveanother layer until the tumulus is finished Where they are groupedtogether and where fortifications remain the spot may have been thefield of some great battle whose slaughtered ranks required many moundsto cover them We know it was the custom of eastern nations to erectmounds over the dead The army of Alexander erected over the body ofDemeratus a monument of earth eight cubits high and of vastcircumference Semiramis raised a mound to the memory of Ninus We readof their erection by the Babylonians in their trenches during siegesWho were the people that erected these tumuli is wrapped in mysterywhich I shall not endeavor to penetrate but refer you to Delafield’sAntiquities of America who seems to have discovered much in the Mexicanrecords which throws light upon the subject It is his opinion theywere Sycthians who crossed to this country over Behring’s Straits andthese people were once the builders of the tower of Babel and dweltupon the plains of Shinar When dispersed by the confusion of tongues aportion of them wandered through Tar196tary to the ocean and therecrossed and gradually passed down the North American continent toMexico and Peru He deduces his evidence from 1st Philology—asthreefifths of the American dialects resemble the language of northernAsia twofifths the Coptics and others the Sycthian which last hetraces in the tribes of South American and the others to the NorthAmerican savages 2nd Anatomy which proves ‘there is much resemblancebetween the cranium of the race of the mounds and ancient Peru withthose of the modern Hindoos’ mythology and hieroglyphics architecturemanners and customs The pyramids of Mexico Peru our country and theSycthian nations are the same with little variation some of earthand others of stone Mr Delafield gives a plan of a building used as areceptacle of the remains of the princess Tzapotee in Mexico which muchresembles some of the ruins in Ohio This is called Mignitlan the placeof desolation In the article upon manners and customs he relates thediscovery of some shells of the pyrula perversa in a tumulus which areused in Asia at religious ceremonies and only found upon the coasts ofIlindostan He traces these nations from the plains of Shinar toTartary where are numerous mounds some in groups as they are foundhere all containing bodies with idols and implements of warprovisions c In his interesting book he exhibits the celebratedAztec map upon which by hieroglyphical figures their course is tracedfrom Behring’s Straits to Mexico and Peru Among other figures we seethere a boat rowed by a man meaning crossing the water a large treeindicating their arrival from the icy regions to a fertile land a197rushing river telling of the Mississippi and lastly a Mexican plantdenotes their arrival in that land Surrounding and between thesefigures are hieroglyphics signifying battles towns built sacrificescouncils feasts c and the number of years that the tribe remainedin one place He has sustained his hypothesis very ably and yet we maysay with Schoolcraft this is a race ‘whose origin whose history andwhose annihilation live only in conjecture’ It is to be hoped thecitizens of St Louis are aware of the treasures enclosed within thecity and will take measures for their preservation—the place would becapable of much ornament as a public garden As our country becomessettled these interesting reliques will be destroyed if care be nottaken to prevent it Their number may give us an idea of the myriads whoonce roved over these plains and we may say while passing through theregions of the west we are travelling over a ‘buried world’ Besidethese races the Spanish French English and Americans have lived anddied here',\n"," 'The city of St Louis which is now so filled with Americans that it israpidly

visited bymeans of the steam ferry boats which were crossing continually toIllinois town had we not imagined we were soon to depart—and inwatching the busy crowds upon the wharf among whom was an old negrobefore an auction200 store attracting customers by ringing a bell insteadof using a red flag as with us—but when night came and we were obligedto pass it in our hot narrow berths among mosquetoes which no net wouldkeep off—listening to the noise and profane converse of the crew of theboats around and imbibing the perfume of a dock we became very muchvexed and very impatient to be on our way',\n"," 'July 15th It was ten o’clock this morning before we started and thendiscovered it was the arrival of a large party of St Louis fashionableswhich had kept us stationary and who instead of coming as expectedchose to remain to attend a party that night',\n"," 'We who had been used to the punctuality of our eastern cities wherethe captain stands watch in hand to give the signal for moving

voyages and requiremuch freight and passengers to pay their expenses',\n"," 'From St Louis to Cincinnati is eighthundred miles for which we wereto pay twelve dollars each and finding only a few passengers engagedthe captain waited for this party hoping in the meanwhile some of theupper steamboats would arrive and bring him some more freight orpassengers The only thing we could reasonably complain of was his badfaith if he had openly told us the state of the case we should havequietly remained in our hotel awaiting his summons instead of placingthe delay to the broken machinery some

beholding this famous country The Illinoisshore is low covered with forest and is the rich part of the Statewhich was called by the Spaniards American bottom bottom land beingthe alluvion which is found upon the river shores between the water andthe bluffs and which is usually overflowed at high water A featurepeculiar to the county is the land nearest the river is highest owingto the constant deposit and when the water retires lakes are left alongthe low land which gradually dry away This bottom extends from theKaskaskiah river to the mouth of the Missouri two miles from Altoneighty miles—and from one half to two miles in length to the bluffswhich bound it containing two hundred and eightyeight thousand squareacres The soil is of inexhaustible fertility averaging from twenty totwentyfive feet Coal is abundant in this alluvion and in the bluffsThis is carried to St Louis in great quantities over the railroad toIllinois town The Missouri side rises into high limestone

of geology at Alton has another theoryand attributes the location and course of their rivers to fissures inthe coal measures One side of the fractured strata is raised and theother depressed so that perpendicular rocks do not appear upon bothsides of the rivers Whether this be the cause of their direction I knownot but that the cliffs occur upon but one side of the stream Iobserved upon the

just plungedover some high ledge of rocks Upon its bosom it bears a forest oftrees some old and waterworn shorn of their honors and some tornaway in all the glory and beauty of their youth The water

one hundred to four hundred feet high or a soft green prairiesloping banks impenetrable marshes large cities and pretty villagesThe clay which the Missouri brings with it is heaped upon the shores orin a pile at the bottom of the river upon which a snag a long trunk ofa tree is flung which standing upright pierces the bottoms ofvessels or as a sawyer rises and falls to strike the unfortunate barkwhich happens to pass over it The danger from these is however muchdiminished by the ingenuity of Captain Henry M Shreve who hascontrived a machine worked by steam by means of which when the wateris low he raises the snags and sawyers from the river We were told hethis year extracted fifteen hundred besides tearing away from the banksmany thousands which were ‘topling to a fall’ It seems a hopeless taskto pull away the hanging trees from the wooded shores of a river threethousand one hundred and sixty miles long whose banks are constantlyunder207mined by the waters besides the Ohio

fashionables on a jaunt ofpleasure to the Sulphur Springs of Virginia some travelling merchantsand several persons visiting the towns upon the river A state room wasobserved to be constantly closed and a young man about twenty whooccasionally came from it squeezed himself in as if afraid hiscompanion would be seen from without The curiosity of the young ladieswas soon excited and by means of the chambermaid they ascertained itwas the young man’s wife a young girl apparently about fourteen whowas thus carefully secluded A runaway match was immediately whisperedabout the young people became quite in a fever to obtain a glimpse ofthe fair heroine It was a long time ere their wish was gratified asshe never left her room taking even her meals there Our mornings onboard are generally very social the ladies sitting with the gentlemenof their party upon the guards or gath210ering in groups with their workwhile the male passengers are smoking talking politics or gamblingThe negro banjo and merry laugh or joke of some son of Erin echoesup from the lower deck but in the afternoon the siesta is the fashionand every one turns in his berth to take a nap I did not follow thiscustom as I was unwilling to lose any of the scenery so that I usuallystole out of my state room like a mouse from its hole and after a longlook up and down the river stole in again the heat being too great toallow of a long stay Yesterday afternoon oppressed with thirst andwith heat for the thermometer on board stood at ninetysix I went intothe ladies’ cabin in search of water a jar of which filled with lumpsof ice was placed upon a marble table in one corner of the cabin Theladies were all in their berths except two who were using every ‘meansand appliance’ to keep themselves cool They were each in a rockingchair kept in motion their feet upon an ottoman made a table for theirbooks while a large feather fan in one hand and a lump of ice inanother were tolerable arms against the fire king Miss Martineauexpatiates upon the indifference of our females to the scenery ofnature and I dare say she would place these two upon her list of niladmirari ladies but travellers are very apt to look upon the surface ofthings these ladies and indeed almost all we meet in steamboats havebeen so often over the scene that they know it by heart and need notbrave heat and storms to see it as a stranger would Our people are arestless body and men women and children are always upon the move Asthirsty as I was I hesitated to drink the thick muddy water for while211standing in our tumblers a sediment is precipitated of half an inch Ohhow I longed for a draught of cool spring water or a lump of Rocklandlake ice While drinking one of the ladies advanced for the samepurpose ‘Dear me what insipid water’ she said ‘it has been standingtoo long I like it right thick’ I looked at her in surprise ‘Do youprefer it muddy to clear’ I asked ‘Certainly I do’ she replied ‘Ilike the sweet clayey taste and when it settles it is insipid HereJuno’ calling to the black chambermaid who was busy ironing ‘get mesome water fresh out of the river with the true Mississippi relish’Every one’s back is indeed fitted to his burden This person had livedupon the banks of the Mississippi had drank its waters all her daysand now it required to be muddy ere it was palateable The chambermaiddescended to the lower deck where a gallant black beau drew a bucketfrom the river and after satisfying the lady she resumed her ironingAgainst this practice of ironing in the ladies cabin I must uplift myvoice I suffered from this annoyance upon the Illinois Mississippi andOhio Constantly there was a woman washing upon the lower deck wherethe water thrown from the wheel falls upon the deck in a prettycascade and another is ironing above All the ironing of the boat andcrew and often of the passengers is done in the ladies small sittingroom the steam and perfume of the wet clothes charcoal furnace and ofthe ironer is extremely disagreeable In one instance I knew this to bethe case all night the girls taking it by turns and I never travelledone day without this addition to the heat and other discomforts of asteamboat In such long voyages it212 may be necessary to wash for thecaptain and crew but surely bed and table linen enough might beprovided to reach Cincinnati where they stop long enough to have themwashed If not why may there not be a room in some other part of thedeck The captain in some instances reaps the profits as thechambermaids are his by hire or purchase and if they charge all as theydid us one dollar and fifty cents a dozen the profit must beconsiderable It is sometimes as in our case a great convenience totravellers but another place should be provided But to go on with myafternoon adventures I left the cabin and walked out upon the shadyside of the guards All was still except the booming steampipe everyone was asleep or reading I leaned over the railing and found the banjoplayer and his audience all in slumbering attitudes or swinging intheir hammocks and every thing denoted silence and repose Suddenly aterrific and astounding bang clang and clatter as if the boat had beencracked to atoms the wheel house was broken in pieces the boards flewover me and a torrent of water flowing from it nearly washed me fromthe deck In a moment every one tumbled out and rushed upon the deckexclaiming ‘what’s the matter’ ‘are we snagged’—‘has the boilerburst’—‘is it a sawyer’ The old Kentucky lady who had stepped outfirst took her pipe from her mouth and said quietly ‘It’s only a log’‘Oh only a log’ ‘nothing but a log’ echoed from every mouth andreturning to their cabins they all stepped into their berths again Ilooked around me in amazement ‘Only a log’ said I to myself and whatis a log The steamboat is broken and stops all is confusion and crashand I am told it is noth213ing but a log ‘Madam’ said I turning to theKentucky woman ‘will you have the goodness to tell me what a log is’‘There they are’ she said pointing with her pipe to the riverFloating along like so many alligators were long branchless trunkswhich had been wafted along thousands of miles from the Rocky Mountainsperhaps ‘But pardon me madam how are these logs able to create such adisturbance’ ‘You seem a stranger child’ she replied ‘as these arefloating along and we are riding among them what more natural thanthat they should get in the water wheel break it and stop the boatBut see the carpenters are already at work and I dare say they willhave it repaired in the course of two or three hours’ So saying sheknocked the ashes out of her pipe took off her cap and passed into herstate room to sleep away the hours we were doomed to pass under a Julysouthern sun inactive The most remarkable event connected with thisaccident was the discovery of the fair unknown of the closedstateroom When the noise was first heard the young man rushed outbearing a plump rosy young girl in his arms who as soon as he put herdown began to tell the beads of a long rosary which hung from her neckOne glance sufficed to tell him the nature of the accident and he lefther to walk towards the wheel house just as the Kentucky ladydisappeared Seeing the poor thing’s agitation I turned towards her andendeavored to sooth her ‘I thank the Virgin Mary it is no worse’ shesaid kissing her cross ‘but something dreadful will come to punish mywickedness Oh how could I leave my dear mother Abbess and the sisters’Stopping sud214denly she gazed around her in affright for she hadunconsciously said more than she intended ‘Oh dear what am I saying’she exclaimed ‘where is Edward why did he leave me’ I soon succeededin soothing her and when I related my conversation with the old womanshe laughed merrily at my ignorance Her young husband returned and wasso delighted to see her cheerful that he immediately drew chairs weall sat down and were soon as social as old friends I was much amusedwith the surprise of my companion who had come in search of me when hesaw me upon such familiar terms with this mysterious couple The littlecreature seemed delighted to escape from her confined quarters

shore before and afterthis The mouth of the cave is an arch about thirty feet high This cavehas in the time of the flat boats been a sort of tavern where the crewand passengers have waited sometimes

its head waters and spreads away upon each sidethrough Ohio and Kentucky and along the Alleghany mountains The strataof this formation consists of sandstone limestone coal argillaceousrocks and slate stones but the peculiar rock from which the salt wateris drawn is a white calcareous sand rock full of cells and vacantplaces once containing salt There is also an upper layer of white sandrock from which a small quantity is produced23 To procure this theboring is sometimes carried very deep several hundred feet as thestrata generally lie below tide water in this valley and some wellsare sunk

retain the name of Lick as Buffalo LickBig Bone Lick etc At the lick upon the Kenawha the paths worn bythese animals are still visible For many years salt was brought to thewestern valley with great labor over the Alleghany mountains upon thebacks of horses and sold for two or three dollars a pound Now it canbe procured at the salines for half a cent Around the salines arefragments of broken pottery and other Indian articles showing theaborigines were in the habit of digging for it Upon Salt creek nearShawneetown is a very ancient salt work which was once resorted to bythe Indians Vessels

is here in progress So if you have a mind toemigrate come to Illinois We have today passed several villages uponeach side of the river possessing little of interest to write youexcept Hoarsville upon the Kentucky shore where we stopped a littlewhile There is a coal mine in its vicinity The Indiana shore presentsan elevated bank upon which we continually saw farms and cottages butthe opposite shore is low and subject to inundation which gives it alonely appearance Both sides however are adorned with beautiful treesHere beside giant beech walnut and various oaks were the pretty redbud cercis canadensis the Ulmus Americana red maple sassafrascornus florida upon the Kentucky bank besides extensive groves ofcotton wood were the basswood or American lime with its yellowtassels the gum American nettle with its red berries June berry andan endless variety of others beautiful and rare Fairy isles areoccasionally passed covered with pretty shrubs and flowers and fringedwith the soft bushy willow called here tow Indiana shows many prettyvillages embowered among her trees or scattered along her slopingbanks and we have today passed Troy Evansville Rockport RomeFredonia Manchport while the other224 side Westport is quite aconspicuous and pleasing town situated upon a high bluff its housesperched like eagles nests upon the high points of the cliff while thebrick courthouse stands upon the bank beneath The river upon bothsides had for many miles back presented a succession of these bluffswild and rugged but after leaving Rockport the rocks become more likeregular hills rising gradually to a high summit cone shaped coveredwith lofty trees and a carpet of verdure We here saw that singularfeature of Ohio shore scenery the hills upon one shore faced with alevel plain upon the opposite shore Each shore presents a succession ofhill and valley the hills on one side being opposed to the valley ofthe other As if while the river ran from east to west the stratacrossed it N E and S W a rupture in these would leave room for theriver This agrees with the theory of our Alton friend that thelocation and course of this river was caused by a rupture in the coalmeasures The boys upon the Ohio have imitated the Illinois ducks intheir pastime of which I wrote you when our boat has passed they pushoff the shore into the agitated water of our wake and seem to take muchpleasure in bobbing up and down We sailed under cliffs this afternoonof rough rugged jagged limestone with precipices and romantic dellsquite sufficient to satisfy a whole boarding school of romantic missesThe setting sun cast his shadows far over the river leaving us inshade while far above the trees which fringed the cliffs were paintedwith gold A ray piercing through a vista in the rocks fell upon thewindows of the pretty town of Evansville tipping its spires withburnished gold lighting225 up the windows as if each house kept highfestival Tint after tint of all this glory has faded and see theriver is white with mist now rising high above the trees After theintense heat of the day this strikes you with a chill and they who knowits fatal effects hasten within—reluctantly I

cut is in some places ten feet deep There are fourlocks The amount of tolls received here from eighteen hundred andthirtyone to eighteen hundred and thirtyseven was according to JudgeHall four hundred

and when we had bothascended the Maine which we had passed upon the226 river yesterdayentered the first lock so that we had the novel spectacle of threelarge steamboats filled with merchandize and passengers all at onetime rising and falling in several locks The locks are large enough forfirst class boats and the whole of the canal is finished in the mostsolid and beautiful manner It is fifty feet wide at surface No horsesare used we passed through by steam The strata cut through at thecanal presented 1st friable slate three inches five feet of fetidlimestone containing petrifactions water

principal business streetand is lined with rows of shops upon each side for it seemed to me amile and in the suburbs iron and cotton factories steam mills cThe private houses are handsome and some of the new ones built of thenative limestone threaten to rival any in the State The hotels seemedcalculated to accommodate a large number of227 travellers The court housewhich is now building is very

myselfwhen the young catholic runaway I mentioned before rushed in andthrowing herself beside me hid her head in my lap exclaiming ‘Oh theyare here my mother my father they will separate me from Edwardforever’ I looked towards the door with much anxiety for I had heardthe southern planters were a gouging raw head and bloody bones sort ofpeople who whipped a slave to death once a week and I feared for thefate of the poor young wife My information however had been taken fromforeign tourists and I found this idea like many others I had imbibedfrom them was far from truth Imagine my surprise when a pleasantgood humored looking man entered the room and seating himself in achair gave way to a hearty fit of laughter His wife a tall slenderladylike looking personage walked directly up to her daughter andfolded her in her arms while gentle tears flowed over her cheeks Ilooked at the father in perplexity wondering at his extraordinarymerriment and at Edward who stood beside him having I thought a mostunbecoming smirk upon his countenance The lady looked up to her husbandreproachfully but said nothing ‘My dear madam’ he said at last to me‘I understand you have taken a kind interest in my little girl’sconcerns and I owe it to you229 to explain the circumstances of the caseAnxious to give my daughter the best of education I sent her to aconvent not far from my estate where there were some very accomplishedladies from Europe who could teach her all I wished her to know Butwhen I went to take her home my lady fancied herself a catholic andrenounced her home and

make us a visit In telling him my difficulties Iadded how glad I should have been had this not occurred to give herand my plantation to him ‘I will scale the convent and carry her off’he said in a jest The idea struck me as a good one I pressed it uponhim and you see here they are and have my hearty blessing’ The brideas her father spoke had gradually dried her tears and raised her heada little When she began to understand the denouement she first blusheddeeply with mortification then pouted and at last burst suddenly intoa merry laugh and ran like a fawn into her father’s outspread armsexclaiming ‘Oh you naughty papa you good for nothing papa’ The partysoon after departed and I received kind expressions and adieus fromall and a few tears from the bride All pressed us to visit them andthe father said if we would only come to Big Bloody Bone Buffalo Lickhe would show us the finest blue grass fields best corn and tobaccoand heartiest negroes in all old Kentuck And if I wanted a nice younggirl to wait upon me I should have the pick of all his slaves I wasquite delighted to meet with such a romantic adventure for I had beenlooking out230 for something as you must be very tired of hearing aboutnothing but trees and rivers and towns Pray do not think I made thisout of my fertile brain I assure you it is true',\n"," 'After leaving Louisville the shores become more cultivated upon eachside than they have been Extensive cornfields in Indiana show theyare as great ‘corncrackers’ as their neighbors The houses are betterbuilt and always of brick or limestone as pine

of brick faced with marble andadorned with a portico in front of the same material Our setting sunis obscured by dark frowning clouds which threaten us with a storm Itcomes in whirling spray and wind which makes our stout bark rock underus and the terrific thunder outroars our groaning steampipe In thecourse of half an hour it was over but hundreds of lofty trees had beenswept from the banks and now were floating past us in all their leafyhonors A sudden stop in our boat’s speed sent us all out to ascertainthe cause I asked if it were another log but found the engine had metwith some breakage which would detain us a little while The steamboatwas laid by the shore and took this opportunity to get a supply ofwood As the evening was mild we left the boat for a stroll and to saywe had been in Indiana With some little effort we climbed the cliffsand when there found ourselves in front of a neat farm house surroundedby barns and orchards The passengers spread themselves about in everydirection and we were very much provoked to see some of them wantonlypulling off the young green apples and throwing233 them to the hogs foramusement I do not know what kind of consciences these people had—Iwould as soon have stolen the farmer’s pigs as his apples but I knowmen and boys are always rather lax in their morality towards appleorchards Prompted by a Yankee curiosity to see the inside of an Indianacottage I opened the gate and after passing through a small courtyardadorned with flowers we entered the open door and found ourselves in aneat apartment with comfortable carpets chairs etc This room openedagain upon a long piazza at the side of the house ornamented with a rowof clean bright churns and milk pans The farmer and his wife nowentered followed by a troop of children bearing pails loaded withfoaming rich milk They were surprised to find strangers in their houseand quite a crowd in front of it Soon understanding the case theykindly invited us to be seated and offered us a choice of new milk orhard cider They had emigrated here from New York State soon after theirmarriage and having hewed themselves a home in the forest hadgradually by industry and perseverance brought every thing around themto its present flourishing condition They seemed happy and healthyFrom their door there was a lovely view of the winding river and theplains of Kentucky opposite When we had descended to the shore weamused ourselves gathering specimens of the rocks They were a hard darkbrown limestone and appeared a mass of organic remains containingencrini terabratula and orthoceratites We searched the pebbles alongthe shore in hopes of finding some of the pretty silecious specimenswhich I had found upon the Illinois but succeeded however in pickingup234 only some small pieces of jasper and a few petrified shells At alittle distance a flat boat was drawn up to the shore and fastened to atree one of those long odd looking species of water craft which oncewas the only kind seen upon these rivers A man came from it and as hereached us bade us politely good evening and asked what we weresearching for Some persons would have found his conduct very improperand his question impertinent but I never mistake the frank kindindependent manner of my countrymen for impertinence We returned hissalute and informed him of the object of our search ‘You’ll findnothing here so pretty as is on the Mississippi and lake Superior I’vebeen pretty much over them regions and found some rale beauties—theyare called cornelions and red a’most as

which she’ll show you ma’am ifyou walk there’ I looked up at the boat from whose windows severalfemale heads were taking observations and concluded to go there Wefollowed our new acquaintance into his ark which I found was his houseand shop he being a floating pedlar and had anchored or rather tiedhis ark to the rocks here to avoid the storm His boat was not thecommon flat boat but was of the species called keel boats andoccasionally carried a sail In addition to his sail he used oars andpoles to propel it with It was a rudely built affair just high enoughwithin for a man to stand but every thing was comfortably arranged Hiswife and his other woman were setting the supper table At235 his requestshe readily displayed her stores and would have pressed them upon me ifI would have taken them After we had returned to our boat we lookedtowards the shore and beheld the crew assembled for a jumping matchThey were a motly assemblage of firemen covered with soot pilotsstewards etc They formed a line—one of them placing himself in thecentre holding a stone in each hand swayed himself backward andforward and then sprang some jumping eighteen twenty and twentytwofeet with the greatest ease While crew and passengers were thusamusing themselves we were aroused by the cry of ‘The Ione is comingaway boys away’ and bounding over the shore they were soon in theboat We understood the meaning of this sudden cry and were much amusedwith the amazement and terror depicted in the countenances of those whodid not ‘What is coming’ they cried ‘Bears wolves sawyers what’It was soon all explained the Ione was in view which we had leftbehind us and it was feared it would arrive at Cincinnati before usThe hands were working with all their might the breakage was finishedthe paddle threw

would remain up alarmed and uncomfortable one wentso far as to threaten to faint if the captain did not slacken hisspeed236 but we were laughed at by the gentlemen who enjoyed the sportHour after hour of the night passed away while we rushed swiftly throughthe waters with our foe just in our rear ‘Hurra fling on more wood’was the cry from below High blazed the furious fire illuminating thewater around the steam increased—the engine worked madly—the boatstrained and groaned at every stroke and seemed actually to spring outof the water Behind us came our rival puffing panting snortingthrowing out volumes of flame and sparks like some fiery dragon of oldand as she came near we could see into her lower deck where around thefierce fire shadowy forms were rushing bounding carrying woodheaping it on shouting and cursing One strain too much—one uprightsnag in our path and we should all be strewed some hundred souls uponthe water writhing agonizing dying—and all for what that we mightarrive one hour the sooner in the night at Cincinnati where we shouldbe obliged to lie still till morning or perhaps it was the honor ofbeating another boat—honor here setting the steam in motion as well asthe sword Our rival unable to compete with us abandoned the race andwas soon left behind our people satisfied with this wonderful triumphrelaxed in their speed the ladies recovered from their fears

throughout the west and is consequently verycheap being two four or eight cents a bushel in different places Theiron and salt furnaces and manufactories of the west owe their presentflourishing trade

activepart in the affray The little settlement was once attacked by threehundred and eighty Indians when Col Zane had with him but thirtythreemen but the women shouldered their rifles joined in the battle and didmuch execution Once in despair the garrison inclined to a surrenderbut a young girl named Betsey Wheat answered them in such an eloquentand indignant burst of irony that they rallied and

distance of nearly three hundred miles Through this valley winds ingraceful bends the noble Ohio eleven hundred miles from its source andnine hundred and fortyeight from its junction with the265

region of countryuniting so many advantages The dark clouds of slavery which shadow itsborders is the only spot in its fair horizon The valley of the Ohio isin the centre of a great plain which as the Appalachian chain waselevated raised up that portion and consequently the rivers which flowover that division come with more impetuosity and dig for themselvesdeep trenches in the earth Many who have carefully examined this regionare of opinion the regular hills which border the Ohio and many of itstributaries are parts of the primitive plain which the streams haveworn down into their present shapes In this valley lies that great coalbasin which is so ably described by Dr Hildreth in the American Journalof Science It extends over four or five degrees of latitude and asmany of longitude A

had stopped justat dusk He for some time felt a little fear but the night had nearlyworn away and he had not seen any one when soon after midnight as hewas pacing slowly along he fancied he caught a glimpse of a manstanding by the road side just before him He gazed intently through thedarkness and saw distinctly two men who drew farther out of themoonlight into the shade of the trees as he approached He knew not whatto do he was not armed no house was near and if he left the road hemust be lost in the pathless woods Go on he must and he determined toput spurs to his horse and dart past them He gazed forward to see ifhis path were clear a deep silence reigned around when ‘Dismount andgive up your270 money’ resounded like thunder in his ears echoing awayamong the silent aisles of the

striped with black This is sometimes calledmoose wood as the moosedeer always seeks with avidity its tenderleaves and bark The box elder also occurs upon these slopes with theholly and varieties of the magnolia the turpelo gum tree besidesnoble forests of many other trees The road although leading overmountain ridges and passes is not a lonely one as stages loaded withpassengers were continual passing and huge Pennsylvanian waggons withthe large Normandy horses high collar and jingling a bell to givenotice of their approach The women of the country we often met uponhorseback sitting upon their gaily embroidered saddles The fine broadsmooth National road over which we were passing enabled the drivers tokeep their horses upon a very quick trot I am fond of rapid drivingbut sometimes it made me rather nervous to dash at the rate of eightmiles an hour within two feet of a precipice down which we looked uponthe tops of trees a thousand feet below There is however very littledanger as where the descent is steep the driver can in a moment byputting his foot upon a spring at his side cramp the wheel and checkour speed After ascending a high mountain we found a tavern whosesign bore the hospitable words ‘Welcome from the west’ We were muchpleased with this kind reception until upon looking back perceivedupon the other side of the273 sign ‘welcome from the east’ I wish thegood lady who erected a statue to Clay would place a monument upon theAlleghanies to commemorate honest Daniel Boon who claims to be thefirst who discovered the fair western plains Sir Alexander Spotswood agovernor of Virginia penetrated part of the way through the mountainsThere was no National road then and the hills were almost impassableTo stimulate discovery he instituted the order of the goldenhorseshoe for those who could pass the Blue Ridge He was anxious tocounteract the influence of the French upon the Mississippi Thereshould also be a statue to good old Father Marquette upon the shore ofLake Michigan as before him no white man had penetrated farther inthe wilderness He persevered and discovered the Mississippi We passedseveral towns as Smythfield Petersburg Frostburg Cumberland cThis last town is in Maryland upon a branch of the Potomac one hundredand forty miles from Baltimore The scenery around it is beautiful Itlies in a valley through which glistens the Potomac river surroundedby mountains We reached it this morning after descending a slope whichseemed to rise one mass of rocks above us The town has several largehotels a college courthouse and many shops We stopped here tochange horses Here commences the transition formations the Appalachianrange dividing the transition from the secondary formations of thewestern valley So clear and distinct is this division that thecelebrated geologist Dr Aikin fixed upon the ground betweenCumberland and Hancock forty miles distant as the spot where theAppalachian chain emerged from beneath upheaved274 by igneous action Themountain which we descended to Cumberland is called the Alleghany bypreeminence it being the highest elevation and is the ridge whichdivides the waters which flow into the Ohio from those which reach theAtlantic The rocks which we had observed upon our road were the usuallimestone marl and conglomerates of the west mixed with muchbituminous coal while now we remarked with them grey wacke andtransition slates The Baltimore and Ohio railroad will pass throughCumberland and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal Here also the Nationalcommences and we there left it but found a very good one whichcontinued with some failures during the day We dined at Pine Grove asmall village Near the hotel is a sulphur spring which we were obligedto taste to gratify the landlord and which was as nauseous as onecould desire This afternoon we passed some very pretty mountainscenery none so high as those we had left behind for we were only uponthe steps which lead down from the ridge to the plains below FromSidling Hill we looked down into a large valley surrounded by a circleof hills through which a river winding its way formed several islandsIn the centre was a high rounded knoll covered with fields of ripenedgrain its bright yellow contrasting well with the dark woods whichsurround it They have a curious way here of laying the grain when cutin squares or circles which looks very pretty at a distance We tooktea at Hancock a town upon the banks of the Potomac The Chesapeake andOhio canal is finished as far as this place We were but little overhalf way to Baltimore here having come we were told one hundred andsixty275 miles from Wheeling Another night was passed in the stage onlyvaried by occasional stoppages to change horses About daybreak westopped at Hagarstown a very large thriving place containingchurches academies and many handsome private dwellings The hotelwhich we entered while the horses were changed was large and seemedvery commodious After leaving it we found the valley in which itstands was very highly cultivated It is underlaid with a dark bluelimestone the soil is very rich and the wheat which it produces issent to Baltimore and highly esteemed We saw some of this limestonewhich occasionally cropped out veins of calcareous spar crossed theblue in some instances Quartz pebbles and large nodules were spreadover the country for miles between this town and Frederic as if astorm of enormous hail had spent its fury over the land Rounded piecesas large as a man’s fist and white as milk lay against the fences orwere piled up by the husbandman The county to Frederic is very prettyundulating cultivated and well settled while dark masses in thedistant horizon told us our pretty mountains were far behind us',\n"," 'July 26th—At eleven o’clock we reached Frederick city where webreakfasted This is a very pretty city having an air of antiquity aswe now had arrived in an old settled country and the newly paintedtowns were giving place to what are called old although not what anEuropean would deem aged I was almost too sleepy to see much of it butas we rattled over paved streets and looked upon rows of houses weseemed quite at home

handsomelyfinished having an apartment appropriated to the ladies wherereclining upon the blue satin sofas we relieved our cramped limbs Thecountry between Frederick and Baltimore is very pretty I think it isabout sixty miles from the one place to the other We passed many goodhouses surrounded with fine farms having the shining Monocasy riverwinding among them We crossed this and the Petapsco over severalbridges The latter river flows between high banks of granite Fifteenmiles from Baltimore are the celebrated Ellicots mills built of thegranite of the cliffs upon which they stand where is ground theexcellent Baltimore flour raised from the fertile country aroundFrederick and Hagarstown Some of the deep cuts of the railroad seem tobe through a mass of debris of all colours red white and blue mixedwith talcose slate and blue limestone until near Baltimore when weentered that granitic belt which stretched through the Atlantic borderto Georgia and which is supposed once to have been the originalAtlantic coast before the band of alluvion was formed After passingmany fanciful country seats and the fine viaduct which leads toWashington we beheld Baltimore an enormous mass of brick and stonelying upon the shore of Petapsco bay Our western friends were delightedand surprised at the sight of so large a city while driving through thestreet We arrived at Barnham’s large and elegant hotel just as theywere eating dinner We had infringed upon our Sabbath277 thus far withoutintending it as we were told we should arrive in Baltimore in time formorning services In the afternoon and evening however there wasopportunity of joining in public worship which my husband and some ofthe party embraced leaving us the weaker part at home to rest',\n"," 'July 27th—As we did not leave Baltimore until halfpast nine wewere enabled to see much of it Its monuments to Washington and to theheroes of the last war are handsome and the fountain with its coolcanopy of shadowy elms pretty its churches and public buildings verygood but as you are so well acquainted with it I will not trouble youwith any details We entered the railroad car at halfpast nine andreached New York at eleven that night a distance of two hundred milesfor which we paid eight dollars each Several long bridges carried usover Bush creek Gunpowder river and the noble Susquehanna Our westernfriends who had been boasting of their great rivers seemed surprisedat the little use we made of them in travelling ‘It seems’ said ourfair Missouri lady ‘rivers here are of no consequence—indeed are inthe way as you make

many, towns, Newburgh, being, the, mostconspicuous, as, it, is, the, largest, and, it, is, built, upon, a, high, cliff, ofargillaceous, slate, thus, displaying, its, numerous, houses, and, churches, toadvantage, The, opposite, shore, presents, a, beautiful, green, mountain, wallthe, highest, peak, of, which, is, 1689, feet, above, the, river, At, its, footreposes, the, smiling, town, of, Fishkill, I, must, not, linger, thus, by, the, way, Remember, I, have, four, thousand, milesto, travel, and, the, summer, is, passing, Imagine, then, to, yourself, a, broadand, beautiful, river, skirted, with, cultivated, country, with, often, amountainous, back, ground, and, rich, with, ‘, summer, ’s, green, emblazonedfield’—and, wafting, upon, its, waters, rivercraft, of, all, forms, from, thelazy, whaler, returning, after, a, four, year, ’s, cruise, to, the, little, pleasureyacht, There, are, many, towns, on, this, river, one, of, which, Poughkeepsieis, rendered, famous, as, being, the, place, where, Washington, Hamilton, Jayand, Chancellor21, Livingston, met, to, compose, the, Constitution, of, theUnited, States, The, city, of, Hudson, is, agreeably, situated, upon, the, summitof, a, slaty, cliff, commanding, a, view, of, the, Catskill, mountains, and, thetown, of, Athens, on, the, opposite, bank, of, the, river, Imagine, scatteredlike, gems, upon, the, borders, of,

unfortunately, out, of, fashion, and, one, mightas, well, look, for, them, as, for, high, heeled, shoes, Perhaps, they, will, comein, with, the, ancient, modes, If, I, thought, so, I, would, immediately, orderhoop, train, cushion, buckle, high, heel, and, all, the, odious, costumewhich, rendered, my, ancestresses, so, hideous, Alas, I, fear, the, ‘, mincingdryades, ’, with, high, crowned,

put, up, my, papers, Adieu22, June, 15th, 1840, My, dear, E, —, We, shall, of, course, remain, in, Albany, during, the, Sabbath, forthe, pleasure, of, worshipping, that, kind, Friend, who, has, showered, upon, usthe, blessings, we, are, now, enjoying, In, the, morning, we, walked, to, thechurch, of, a, Baptist, clergyman, Mr, W, ——, h, who, has, been, long, celebratedas, a, very, interesting, preacher, This, church, is, a, handsome, marblestructure, surmounted, by, a, dome, and, adorned, by, a, colonade, of, pillars, infront, The, lecture, room, is, below, and, we, ascended, to, the, chapel, a, neatapartment, with, a, good, pulpit, and, commodious, seats, Mr, W, sprang, from, anobscure, station, being, a, mechanic, and, therefore, could, only, obtain, acommon, education, What, he, is, he, has, made, himself, or, rather, was, made, bythe, Holy, Spirit, for, we, all, know, how, religion, refines, and, elevates, theintellect, of, man, as, well, as, his, affections, After, his, conversion, herapidly, improved, and, now, one, is, astonished, at, the, beauty, and, purity, ofhis, language, He, is, not, an, animated, preacher, nor, does, his, forte, liein, arousing, a, sinner, but, he, shows, forth, the23, truth, and, beauty, ofreligion, and, expounds, the, Gospel, doctrines, with, a, power, and, grace, andclearness, which, fascinate, the, hearer, This, church, is, always, crowded, bythe, elite, of, Albanian, society, of, all, sects, and, by, the, strangers, whoare, in, the, city, In, the, afternoon, we, attended, service, in, an, old, Dutch, church, one, of, theoldest, in, the, city, It, is, built, of, brick, and, boasts, two, spires, whichgive, it, a, singular, appearance, The, interior, is, richly, fitted, up, withgilded, chandeliers, and, many, comforts, and, elegant, conveniences, Here, wefound, ourselves, surrounded, by, the, old, Dutch, families, whose, fathersemigrated, from, Holland, and, settled, themselves, here, among, them, were, thefamily, of, the, Patroon, I, looked, around, with, pleasure, upon, the, soberbenevolent, faces, of, the, congregation, for, I, have, always, felt, a, verykindly, sentiment, toward, our, Dutch, brethren, The, peaceful, even, tenor, oftheir, lives, their, contented, spirit, their, industry, and, integrityentitle, them, to, our, most, ‘, golden, opinions, ’, The, Rev, Mr, Y, —, —, whoofficiates, here, is, an, able, solid, preacher, well, versed, in, thefundamental, truths, of, christianity, I, am, happy, to, say, the, people, of, this, city, are, a, very, moral, andreligious, people, This, applies, also, to, the, ‘, first, society’—which, is, asingularity, in, city, history, Beneath, their, influence, theatresdissipation, and, extravagance, can, not, thrive, Already, I, seem, to, breathefreer, although, so, little, distant, from, New, York, whose, atmosphere, rankwith, foreign, luxuries, is, like, a, hot, house, overcrowded, by, fragrantexotics, stifling, us, with, perfume, We, admire, this, city, which, however, we, have, only, been, able, to, see, in, ourodds, and, ends, of, time, Its24, situation, is, very, fine, it, contains, manyhandsome, buildings, and, it, is, generally, kept, very, neat, A, broad, streetthrough, the, centre, leads, up, to, a, pretty, square, surrounded, by, severalimposing, buildings, —, the, Capitol, occupies, a, fine, position, here, it, is, ofdark, stone, with, a, neat, marble, portico, supported, by, four, ionic, columnsThe, City, Hall, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, square, is, a, noble, edificebuilt, of, white, marble, from, the, quarries, of, Sing, Sing, surmounted, by, agilded, dome, The, view, from, this, dome, is, beautiful, embracing, the, city, atyour, feet, —, green, hilly, country, dotted, with, country, seats, and, townsamong, which, is, the, city, of, Troy, —, the, noble, Hudson, winding, among, thiscountry, and, a, back, ground, of, mountains, The, new, State, Hall, is, a, prettybuilding, —, the, Exchange, is, a, huge, mass, of, granite, giving, one, a, greatidea, of, the, extent, of, business, which, requires, so, large, a, structure, forits, merchants, What, a, different, place, is, this, to, the, town, which, stood, upon, this, twohundred, years, since, Then, the, only, public, building, was, a, quaint, oldDutch, church, with, painted, glass, windows, adorned, with, the, coat, of, armsof, those, ancient, worthies, who, clad, in, trunk, hose, and, steeple, crownedhats, sat, demurely, below, There, are, but, few, of, the, ancient, Dutch, housesleft, and, these, are, daily, falling, before, the, yankee, spirit, ofimprovement, —, which, improvement, by, the, bye, sometimes, merely, amounts, toalteration, At, this, city, is, the, southern, termination, of, the, great, ErieCanal25, June, 17th, 1840, My, dear, E, —, We, arose, at, an, early, hour, and, after, looking, into, some, ofthe, public, buildings, we, returned, to, breakfast, This, dispatched, we, droveto, the, rail, road, depot, an, ugly, building, at, the, head, of, State, Streetwhere, we, alighted, and, stood, in, a, large, barnlike, apartment, among, menand, trunks, and, boys, —, the, latter, screaming, Albany, Argus’—‘EveningJournal’—and, among, all, sorts, of, confusion, until, we, were, seated, in, thecars, Soon, however, two, fine, horses, to, whom, I, render, my, thanks, draggedus, out, of, the, barn, into, open, day, —, up, through, the, square, over, the, hillto, the, Locomotive, Depot, giving, us, on, the, way, many, sweet, little, backviews, of, Albany, and, its, pretty, country, and, river, and, the, round, tops, ofthe, Catskills, in, the, blue, distance, beyond, The, snort, of, a, steampipe, andperfume, of, grease, and, smoke, announced, the, vicinity, of, our,

the, engine, attached, and, away, we, rushed, leaving, ourfine, steeds, gazing, after, us, with, tears, in, their, eyes, to, see, themselvesoutdone, by, a, great, teakettle, There, are, many, pretty, villas, along, the, road, breathing, places, for, theheated, citizens, below, which, I, would, describe, to, you, but, dashing, alongat, sixteen, miles, an, hour, speed, I, can, only, catch, a, glimpse, of, whitepillar, and, portico, when, the, next, minute, we, are, three, miles, away, Youmust, expect, no, description, of, the, country, when, I, am, on, a, rail, road, forthe, scenery, is, all, blurred, like, a, bad, lithograph, I, only, saw, groups, ofpine, trees, rushing, past, and, several, bright, dots, which, I, suppose, meantwild, flowers, when, we, came, in, sight, of, Schenectady, an, antique, dutchtown, Before, entering, it, I, was, struck, by, the, vision, of, two, immensetarred, ropes, walking, deliberately, beside, our, car, and, discovered, we, wereupon, an, inclined, plain, descending, which, cars, of, stone, were, brought, upat, the, other, end, of, our, ropes, Our, steam, horse, was, once, more, exchangedfor, one, of, flesh, and, we, set, off, upon, a, jog, trot, Near, the, city, we, passeda, canal, basin, in, which, lay, several, canal, boats, for, the, Erie, Canalpasses, through, here, We, entered, the, city, crossed, the, end, of, a, longstreet, filled, with, bright, looking, shops, where, people, and, horses, werefrisking, about, in, the, morning, air, —, when, another, large, depot, received, usin, its, barnlike, expanse, The, Ballston, and, Saratoga, train, entered, at, theother, end, and, you, may, imagine, the, charming, confusion, as, the, people, ofboth, trains, jumped, in, and, out, the, carriages, marched, and, counter, marcheduntil, they, had, settled, down, into, their, several, seats27, We, were, not, suffered, long, to, look, upon, this, pleasant, picture, for, at, 9o’clock, we, were, on, our, way, to, Utica, We, could, see, but, little, ofSchenectady, while, passing, through, it, but, it, looked, well, at, a, distanceUpon, an, eminence, above, the, town, stands, Union, College, a, fine, building, ofgrey,

many, different, nations, —, the, Mohawk, theFrench, the, Dutch, and, the, English, having, each, in, succession, ruled, itsdestinies, After, leaving, the, town, we, entered, at, once, the, glorious, valley, of, theMohawk, which, runs, nearly, westerly, and, whose, course, we, followed, eightymiles, to, Utica, There, may, be, lovelier, vallies, in, the, world, butcertainly, not, another, like, this, for, it, is, unique, in, its, kind, Imagine, along, green, valley, covered, with, rich, farms, —, through, its, centre, a, brighttransparent, river, having, a, rail, road, on, one, bank, and, a, canal, on, theother, while, a, range, of, hills, frame, in, the, picture, on, each, side, Sostraight, is, this, valley, that, canal, river, and, rail, road, run, paralleland, within, sight, of, each, other, nearly, all, the, way, It, was, one, of, June, ’s, sweetest, mornings, when, we, passed, the, shores, of, thepretty, Mohawk, and, I, was, never, weary, of, gazing, down, into, its, smilingface, as, we, glided, along, or, of, watching, the, lazy, canal, boat, draggingits, rich, freight, at, the, foot, of, those, soft, green, hills, opposite, or, ofpeeping, out, the, coach, at, the, rugged, cliffs, which, reared, their, bareheads, far, above, our, road, There, are, many, little, villages, on, this, route, where28, we, stopped, torefresh, ourselves, or, to, fill, the, engine, The, first, was, Amsterdam, asmall, Dutch, settlement, Near, this, place, stands, a, handsome, stone, edificewhich, is, renowned, in, the, annals, of, New, York, as, the, residence, of, GreyJohnson, and, his, brother, Sir, William, the, dreamer, At, these, towns, thereare, hotels, and, at, other, spots, refreshment, houses, built, at, the, roadside, where, you, are, allowed, a, few, minutes, to, rest, You,

station, the, tables, were, crowded, andat, the, signal, they, rushed, into, the, cars, each, with, a, cake, or, pie, orapple, to, finish, at, his, leisure, We, may, say, with, Horace, One, would, imagine, he, was, speaking, of, our, little, Fonda, which, is, herepronounced, as, Horace, spells, it, It, was, named, after, the, celebrated, ColFonda, Fort, Plain, is, a, pretty, place, on, the, other, bank, of, the, river, here, Ilonged, to, ‘, stay, one, turn, ’, to, hammer, a, specimen, from, the, encrinallimerock, which, is, found, there, The, little, falls, of, the, Mohawk, is, adelightful, place, The, river, here, forces, its, way, through, a, rocky, countryand, falls, over, successive, ledges, of, rock, in, pretty, cascades, The, beautyof, the, scene, does29, not, consist, in, altitude, but, in, number, and, variety, ofthese, saults, and, the, foaming, river, rushing, over, its, rocky, bottom, orwinding, around, its, tiney, islets, and, in, the, towering, cliffs, around, itThe, village, is, seated, upon, each, side, of, the, river, connected, by, ahandsome, marble, aqueduct, leading, to, the, canal, basin, and, by, a, neatbridge, for, carriages, The, scene, as, we, approached, was, very, pretty, Yousee, a, frame, work, of, rugged, cliffs, enclosing, a, noisy, rushing, river, withnumerous, cascades, its, shores, crowned, with, white, buildings, and, spannedby, a, noble, bridge, the, canal, boat, is, seen, creeping, at, the, foot, of, thehills, opposite, while, the, steeples, court, house, and, hotels, are, peepingfrom, the, trees, which, cover, the, sloping, bank, at, our, right, Perched, uponevery, jutting, point, and, grouped, around, the, shores, were, many, shantiesoccupied, by, the, children, of, Erin, who, have, kindly, volunteered, to, make, ourrail, roads, and, canals, When, the, train, stopped, before, the, hotel, instead, of, the, usual, sound, of‘Newspapers, ’, or, ‘, Nuts, ’, or, ‘, Apples, to, sell, ’, I, heard, young, voicesasking, if, we, wanted, some, diamonds, Surprised, I, looked, out, and, beheldseveral, little, girls, holding, up, small, boxes, containing, Quartz, CrystalsWe, of, course, became, purchasers, and, found, among, them, some, very, perfectand, pure, ‘, Where, do, you, find, these, ’, I, asked, ‘, Oh, all, among, the, cliffsma’am, ’, she, answered, in, the, Hibernian, tongue—‘and, if, its,

thesehills, and, run, away, to, the, sea, no, one, can, ever, know, The, rocks, here, arelimestone, principally, but, I, observed, there, was, with, it, some, finegranite, There, was, an, old, man, among, our, passengers, who, had, lived, here‘when, all, this, was, a, wilderness, ’, He, amused, us, with, some, stories, of, pasttimes, one, of, which, I, think, interesting, enough, to, tell, you, Here, it, isto, fill, up, the, page, During, the, War, of, Independence, there, were, two, brothers, who, althoughthey, were, brothers, could, not, think, alike, they, joined, opposite, sides, inthe, war, It, happened, while, the, Division, under, Gen, Herkimer, wasdestitute, of, arms, ammunition, and, clothing, he, heard, of, the, approach, ofthe, English, troops, Fight, he, could, not, fly, he, would, not, and, he, wasseeking, some, stratagem, to, better, his, situation, when, fortunately, forhim, the, English, brother, having, strayed, too, near, his, camp, was, taken, upas, a, spy, The, brothers, who, had, been, long, separated, met, once, more, butit, was, a, bitter, meeting, for, one, was, a, prisoner, and, condemned, to, die, Inspite, of, their, different, sentiments, they, loved, each, other, The, prisonerearnestly, entreated, his, brother, who, was, the, General, ’s, Aid, to, use, allthe, influence, in, his, power, to, save, his, life, The, Aid, was, conscious, hecould, not, succeed, unless, he, made, the, ‘, worse, appear, the, better, reason’for, his, brother, had, been, fairly, captured, as, a, spy, and, in, consequence, ofsome, bloody, deeds, of, the, enemy, his, life, was, to, be, forfeited, With, aheavy, heart, and, darkened, brow, he, entered, the, General, ’s, tent, ‘, I, know, what, you, would, ask, ere, you, speak, ’, said, his, commander, ‘, I, haveexpected, you, and, have, de31termined, upon, my, course, You, come, to, ask, yourbrother, ’s, life, —, it, is, your, ’s, upon, one, condition, ’, ‘, Name, it, I, am, notafraid, to, agree, to,

to, find, your, way, back, again, as, you, can, When, you, return, yourbrother, shall, be, free, ’, For, one, moment, the, Aid, hesitated, To, appear, as, a, deserter, —, to, act, thespy, —, to, deceive, even, an, enemy, was, adverse, to, his, open, noblenature, —, there, was, also, danger, of, discovery, when, returning, which, wouldlead, to, disgrace, and, death, ‘, Well, young, man, what, is, your, determination, ’, asked, the, General, ‘, I, willgo, and, trust, in, heaven, and, in, you, ’, He, sought, the, enemy, ’s, camp, wasimprisoned, as, a, spy, —, but, his, feigned, tale, procured, his, liberation, Theenemy, retreated, before, so, large, a, force, which, they, could, have, conqueredif, they, had, known, their, distressed, condition, It, was, many, months, ere, theAid, rejoined, his, General, His, brother, was, released, and, after, a, partingfull, of, sorrow, they, separated, never, to, meet, again, We, arrived, at, Utica, at, three, o’clock, and, repaired, immediately, toBaggs, ’s, hotel, Here, we, found, an, excellent, dinner, just, ready, which, tohungry, travellers, is, a, cheering, sight, As, I, promised, to, put, down, ourexpenses, we, pay, 375, each, from, Albany, to, Utica, eighty, miles, We, hereconcluded, to, leave, the, train32, and, spend, a, few, days, at, the, celebratedTrenton, falls, After, partaking, a, very, nice, dinner, at, Bagg, ’s, hotel, weentered, a, neat, carriage, for, Trenton, falls, 14, miles, north, of, Utica, Thedrive, is, a, pretty, one, and, up, hill, all, the, way, We, arrived, at, dark, at, asmall, inn, in, a, forest, and, were, obliged, to, defer, our, visit, to, thecascade, until, the, next, morning, After, breakfast, we, walked, out, to, visit, the, falls, Our, way, was, through, adeep, forest, breathing, forth, sweet, fragrance, in, the, early, morning, airSuddenly, in, the, midst, of, the, woods, we, found, ourselves, upon, the, brinkof, a, precipice, one, side, of, a, narrow, chasm, two, hundred, feet, deep, whiletoo, far, below, to, be, heard, a, mountain, torrent, was, rushing, and, foamingover, the, rock, A, range, of, five, ladder, stairways, led, down, the, steep, —, andas, we, thus, hung, over, the, water, we, felt, very, much, like, some, ofShakespear, ’s, samphire, gatherers, and, thought, what, a, ‘, dreadful, trade, ’, washunting, waterfalls, Safely, down, we, found, a, narrow, ravine, so, filledwith, the, roaring, torrent, that, there, was, scarcely, room, for, a, pathwaybeside, it, Part, of, the, way, a, chain, was, inserted, into, the, rock, that, wemight, by, holding, upon, it, pass, the, boiling, whirlpool, if, our, nerves, arestrong, enough, to, command, our, hands, and, feet, —, so, scrambling, climbingswinging, we, contrived, to, reach, the, uppermost, cascade, which, is, twomiles, from, the, last, one, This, stream, called, the, West, Canada, Creekfalls, down, a, deep, ravine, over, successive, ledges, of, rock, in, six, smallcascades, of, great, beauty, The, highest, is, only, fifty, feet, high, The, sidesof, the, ravine, are, precipitous, and, covered, with, the, beautiful, foliage, ofnumerous, trees, Among, them, are, many, evergreen, trees, —, of, these, I, remarkedthe33, stately, white, pine, which, grows, over, one, hundred, feet, high, andperfectly, straight, the, red, pine, with, its, dark, green, leaves, and, yellowcones, the, black, spruce, and, the, lofty, birch, The, rocks, are, slate, andtransition, lime, stone, of, the, silurian, series, abounding, withpetrifaction, of, which, many, are, perfect, trilobites, Quartz, crystals, arealso, found, here, in, great, beauty, and, profusion, This, place, has, been, thescene, of, some, tragic, events, —, one, of, them, most, pitiable, A, young, girl, satout, upon, a, pleasure, tour, accompanied, by, her, mother, father, andaffianced, husband, They, came, to, this, place, no, warning, spirit, pressingthem, back, no, drear, omen, warning, them, away, and, no, dream, or, presentmentchecking, their, steps, Gaily, they, descended, the, stairs, and, clambered, therocks, —, the, lover, with, the, hand, of, his, betrothed, in, his, the, father, andmother, behind, Being, thus, led, along, did, not, accord, with, her, playfulspirit, and, telling, him, she, could, take, care, of, herself, she, in, an, evilmoment, withdrew, her, hand, His, charge, to, be, careful, was, answered, bysmiling, asseverations, of, her, surefootedness, he, turned, with, anotheradmonition, and, she, was, gone, Where, is, she, He, looks, in, every, directionShe, has, hid, herself, in, play, he, calls, no, answer, but, the, torrents, roarshe, has, rejoined, her, parents, he, turns, towards, them, and, sees, themquietly, reposing, together, upon, a, rock, His, pallid, look, —, his, wildness, asrooted, to, the, spot, he, gazes, upon, them, tells, them, the, tale, of, woe, soonbitterly, confirmed, by, her, pretty, bonnet, of, straw, which, was, at, thatmoment, whirled, past, their, feet, Oh, the, agony, of, those, hearts, as, theystood, beside, that, dark, torrent, away, from, all, help, and, powerless, tosave, their, beloved, one, The, guide, was, des34patched, to, the, village, forhelp, but, not, until, three, days, after, was, she, found, a, mile, below, hertender, form, having, been, thus, far, carried, over, rocks, and, whirlpools, Another, family, party, came, to, view, these, scenes, A, tender, girl, of, elevenyears, was, for, security, consigned, to, the, valet, ’s, arms, One, false, stepplunged, him, into, the, torrent, —, he,

were, floatingthrough, my, memory, their, scenes, pointed, out, to, me, by, the, guide, theplace, lost, all, its, beauty, and, the, dashing, torrent, seemed, some, hugemonster, seeking, whom, he, might, suck, beneath, his, horrid, depths, I, grewnervous, and, much, to, my, companions, surprise, begged, him, to, return, Herejoicing, in, the, fresh, country, air, and, released, from, the, city, ’s, dustran, over, the, rocks, with, to, me, an, alarming, quickness, and, I, turned, todepart, Why, these, beloved, ones, should, be, thus, snatched, away, from, theirfond, relatives, taken, from, their, homes, to, find, their, death, in, this, wildspot, is, to, us, unknown, He, who, commanded, this, has, purposes, to, usunscrutable, perhaps, it, was, to, read, a, lesson, to, those, who, hear, the, taleto, teach, them, the, uncertain, hold, they, have, upon, life, and, all, itspleasures, and, to, fear, that, power, which, can, in, an, unlooked, for, momentbear, them, from, life, to, eternity, There, are, hundreds, every, season, whostand, upon, this, spot, and, hear, this, story, and, the, heart, which, is, notaffected, by, it, must, be, as, the, hearts, of, the, petrified, animals, aroundthem35, We, spent, several, days, here, riding, and, walking, among, the, romanticscenery, The, village, of, Trenton, Falls, is, a, small, one, containing, a, few, shops, andcottages, and, two, churches, one, of, which, is, quite, pretty, The, ridetowards, Utica, is, very, beautiful, The, ground, descends, on, each, side, to, theMohawk, valley, and, while, our, road, wound, down, this, side, we, had, the, wholeslope, of, the, other, side, before, our, eyes, covered, with, orchards, andfields, and, dotted, with, villages, The, town, of, Clinton, with, Hamiltoncollege, stands, upon, elevated, ground, while, below, at, the, river, ’s, brinkis, spread, the, city, of, Utica, Here, we, spent, a, day, looking, about, itsstreets, and, shops, The, ground, slopes, down, to, the, river, near, which, arethe, business, streets, while, most, of, the, dwelling, houses, are, upon, themore, airy, and, elevated, portion, of, the, city, Genessee, street, is, a, finewide, avenue,

surrounded, many, ofthem, by, gardens, and, appeared, very, comfortable, residences, The, businesspart, of, the, city, show, rows, of, well, built, warehouses, and, were, filledwith, people, and, carts, passing, to, and, fro, as, if, their, trade, was, anactive, one, and, their, city, thriving, The, Erie, canal, has, brought, muchtrade, to, this, place, which, now, is, one, of, the, most, flourishing, inlandtowns, in, the, State, The, canal, boats, stages, and, rail, trains, which, areconstantly, arriving, and, departing, give, a, stirring, appearance, to, theplace, Religion,

which, nowof, course, several, thousands, must, be, added, It, is, situated, in, OneidaCounty, which, was, selected, by, the, celebrated, Baron, Steuben, as, hisretreat, and, here, he, was, buried, June, 21st, —, We, left, Utica, today, in, the, three, o’clock, train, forAuburn, About, four, miles, from, the, city, we, passed, a, small, town, calledWhitesborough, a, pretty, place, with, two, churches, an, academy, and, abuilding, called, the, Oneida, Institute, There, is, also, here, a, manual, laborschool, A, large, unfinished, building, just, outside, of, Utica, we, learnedwas, to, be, a, lunatic, asylum, calculated, to, accommodate, one, thousandpatients, —, God, pity, them, Several, pretty, towns, lay, upon, our, route, as, Rome, Manlius, Canastolaetc, Sweet, retreats, from, the, confusion, of, a, city, without, the, solitude, ofthe, country, The, canal, and, railroad, which, run, through, or, near, thesetowns, present, facilities, for, trade, or, travelling, Rome, is, a, place, ofconsiderable, importance, containing, five, churches, a, court, houseacademy, several, shops, and, dwellings, The, population, five, years, sinceamounted, to, 4800, When, arrived, at, Syracuse, we, drove, up, to, a, large, goodlooking, stone, building, bearing, the, name, of, Syracuse, House, There, westopped, to, take, tea, This, place, is, sixty, miles, from, Utica, enjoysconsiderable, trade, but, is, still, in, its, teens, having, arisen, since, thecanal, passed, through, that, part, of, the, country, The, Oswego, canal, joinsthe, Erie, here, which, with, the, salt, works, near, brings, them, muchbusiness, The, population, is, 7000, We, observed, in, passing, through, itseveral, good, churches37, a, pretty, court, house, substantial, ware, housesnumerous, shops, and, dwellings, with, a, lyceum, and, high, school, so, that, itwould, seem, the, inhabitants, ought, to, be, wealthy, refined, and, welleducated, The, salt, springs, are, at, Salina, one, mile, and, a, half, fromSyracuse, where, there, are, eighty, manufactories, of, this, material, Thesesalt, springs, flow, from, beds, of, slate, in, some, places, two, hundred, feetthick, Among, the, layers, are, masses, of, vermicular, rock, whose, intersticesare, supposed, once, to, have, been, filled, with, salt, In, this, region, ofcountry, are, extensive, gypsum, beds, water, lime, is, also, found, inprofusion, Sandstone, generally, old, red, and, limestones, are, theprevailing, formations, of, the, county, It, was, a, beautiful, evening, when, we, left, Syracuse, The, sky, every, whereof, a, clear, deep, blue, paled, gradually, as, it, approached, the, west, whereit, was, lost, in, a, rich, golden, glow, The, spires, of, the, town, behind, usreflected, this, brilliant, hue, and, the, country, as, we, passed, looked, likeone, of, Turner, ’s, one, colored, pictures, Onondaga, lake, with, the, prettyvillage, reposing, upon, its, shore, and, the, rich, fields, around, it, were, alltouched, with, this, golden, pencil, The, fields, were, strewn, with, salt, vatswhere, the, salt, was, undergoing, evaporation, which, were, covered, with, lowsheds, probably, taken, off, in, the, morning, as, it, was, now, late, Saturdayafternoon, and, this, might, have, been, to, protect, them, from, the, weather, Itwas, quite, dark, when, we, reached, Auburn, We, left, the, cars, at, the, railroaddepot, and, were, provided, with, carriages, to, the, American, Hotel, Herelarge, commodious, bed, rooms, and, luxurious, mattresses, received, yourweary, friends, I38, lingered, a, while, to, write, you, the, events, of, the, daybut, must, now, hasten, to, bid, you, —, adieu, Sunday, June, 22d, —, This, morning, we, visited, the, first, presbyterianchurch, a, large, handsome, edifice, of, brick, The, pulpit, was, neat, and, theseats, and, backs, of, the, pews, comfortably, lined, with, horse, hair, From, MrLathrop, the, clergyman, we, heard, a, very, good, discourse, The, baptist, andseveral, other, churches, struck, us, as, very, neat, and, tasteful, Theepiscopal, is, in, the, gothic, style, the, interior, lined, with, oak, andcontaining, a, handsome, monument, of, Bishop, Hobart, who, died, in, this, placeThe, hotels, are, showy, handsome, buildings, particularly, the, Auburn, Houseand, the, American, where, we, have, taken, up, our, quarters, This, last, isbuilt, of, grey, limestone, from, that, neighborhood, and, is, surrounded, by, tworows, of, piazzas, supported, by, handsome, pillars, Opposite, to, it, is, thecourt, house, quite, a, little, palace, in, appearance, It, is, in, the, Parthenonform, with, a, portico, and, high, pillars, with, the, questionable, addition, ofa, large, dome, From, the, cupola, of, an, hotel, we, obtained, a, charming, viewof, this, beautiful, town, and, its, environs, ‘, A, palace, and, a, prison, on, eachhand, ’, I, exclaimed, as, I, glanced, around, for, behind, was, the, grand, courthouse, and, in, front, arose, the, gloomy, walls, and, towers, of, our, famousState, Prison, We, saw, from, here, the, Theological, Seminary, severalhandsome, churches, hotels, elegant, private, dwellings, and, streets, ofshops, while, the, outside, of, the, circle, presented, a, charming, and, variedrange, of, fields, and, hills, and, groves, and, streams, It, seemed, indeed, theloveliest, village, of, the, plain, around, and, I, expressed, my, surprise, atseeing, so, large, and39, well, built, a, town, ‘, so, far, off, ’, My, companion, toldme, it, was, too, near, the, commencement, of, our, journey, to, be, astonished, yetI, had, Rochester, and, Buffalo, and, Cincinnati, to, see, This, town, has, apopulation, of, nearly, 7000, I, do, not, know, exactly, but, refer, you, to, theGazetteers, Those, of, our, friends, whom, we, visited, gave, the, place, a, finecharacter, for, good, society, and, told, us, they, enjoyed, all, theconveniences, and, elegances, of, life, with, good, pastors, and, good, books, Intwentyfour, hours, any, thing, can, reach, them, from, New, York, The, prisonpresents, an, imposing, appearance, It, is, built, of, dark, stone, with, gothicornaments, and, consist, of, first, a, high, wall, enclosing, a, large, squarein, the, centre, of, which, rises, a, massive, pile, of, building, surmounted, by, acupola, This, building, is, arranged, on, three, sides, of, a, square, the, centre276, the, other, 242, feet, long, In, this, are, the, eating, rooms, hospitalchapel, and, cells, The, work, shops, are, erected, against, the, wall, leaving, aspace, for, the, keeper, to, walk, around, and, gaze, upon, them, through, holes, forthe, purpose, himself, unseen, It, is, a, dismal, life, these, poor, creatureslead, not, only, encarcerated, from, the, world, but, confined, alone, andforbidden, even, to, speak, to, a, fellow, prisoner, when, they, meet, at, table, orin, the, shops, They, pass, the, life, of, La, Trappe, monks, except, that, it, isagainst, their, will, At, table, they, sit, in, rows, with, their, faces, one, wayso, that, they, can, not, even, see, each, other, However, this, solitary, andsilent, existence, is, said, to, be, the, best, and, most, successful, method, ofrestraining, and, reforming, the, unhappy, convict, In, solitude, they, havetime, for, reflection, and, silence, prevents, corruption, from, their, fellowcriminals, They, have, religious, instruction, which, has, con40vertedseveral, I, can, not, but, think, it, a, very, efficient, arrangement, The, guiltyman, is, stopped, in, his, mad, career, and, solitude, silence, and, time, forreflection, and, religious, counsel, are, blessings, placed, in, his, path, Inthe, mean, while, his, bodily, wants, are, attended, to, he, is, supplied, withnutritious, food, well, ventillated, rooms, with, nurses, and, physicians, Heis, obliged, to, work, and, the, fruits, of, his, labor, go, to, defray, the, prisonexpenses, We, saw, carriages, shoes, cabinetware, and, various, otherarticles, made, by, them, offered, for, sale, in, the, shops, of, the, village141, June, 23d, 1840, Dear, E, —, At, ten, o’clock, we, entered, the, stage, coach, for, Rochester, 70miles, distant, Among, our, passengers, were, two, whom, we, had, found, extremelyinteresting, while, journeying, from, Utica, here, —, a, clergyman, ofMassachusetts, and, his, daughter, The, Rev, N, T, ——, r, was, about, seventybut, extremely, active, and, very, cheerful, His, conversation, wasinstructive, and, agreeable, and, of, course, in, a, pious, vein, for, he, hadoccupied, the, pulpit, 47, years, as, had, his, ancestors, for, 230, years, backThere, was, such, simplicity, of, heart, about, him, such, piety, and, kindnessof, manner, joined, with, elevated, thought, and, deep, learning, that, we, lent, acharmed, ear, to, his, discourse, during, the, whole, day, Our, route, lay, through, an, exquisitely, beautiful, country, covered, withcultivated, farms, and, varied, with, pretty, lakes, and, towns, The, first, lakewe, saw, was, Cayuga, lake, It, is, from, one, to, four, miles, broad, andthirtyeight, long, It, is, a, bright, sheet, of, water42, lying, in, a, deepvalley, and, from, its, surface, its, shores, gently, rise, covered, with, a, finefarming, country, We, crossed, the, end, of, the, lake, over, a, bridge, more, thana, mile, long, So, pure, was, the, water, that, as, we, looked, down, upon, it, weplainly, beheld, the, trout, swiming, beneath, Leaving, the, lake, we, passed, through, the, pretty, villages, of, Waterloo, andSeneca, Falls, Here, the, dark, green, Seneca, river, rushes, foaming, over, a, bedof, rock, in, a, fall, of, forty, seven, feet, There, are, several, mills, andmanufactories, upon, its, borders, and, we, observed, several, churches, anacademy, and, many, shops, Seneca, fair, Seneca, Lake, how, can, I, describethe, gentle, beauties, of, thy, varied, shores, and, of, that, pretty, town, whichso, adorns, thy, banks, This, lake, and, its, surrounding, country, present, avery, lovely, scene, There, is, nothing, grand, about, the, lakelet, you, mustnot, imagine, it, enclosed, in, the, moutains, of, lakes, George, or, Champlainthe, style, is, petite, and, delicate, Its, Indian, name, was, Jensequa, whichhas, been, modernised, into, its, present, appellation, It, is, a, placidtransparent, sheet, of, water, of, very, great, depth, 4, miles, by, 35, long, andis, said, never, to, be, frozen, over, in, the, coldest, winter, The, road, layaround, the, end, of, the, lake, from, whence, the, eye, wound, over, its, fairpellucid, waters, to, its, cultivated, shores, adorned, with, handsomefarmhouses, and, country, seats, and, the, massive, buldings, of, the, collegewhich, occupies, a, commanding, elevation, near, the, town, —, and, the, towers, andsteeples, of, the, village, peeping, through, the, trees, as, if, to, catch, aglimpse, of, the, waters, below, We, stopped, at, a, small, stage, house, in, thelower, and, business, end, of, the, town, where, we, all, 43descended, from, thestage, while, the, operation, of, changing, horses, and, stages, was, going, on, Agood, sized, parlor, furnished, with, gay, landscape, paper, received, the, femalepart, of, the, passengers, while, the, restless, mankind, part, repaired, tothe, shops, to, inspect, the, manufactures, of, the, town, or, to, refreshthemselves, at, the, sodawater, and, icecream, shops, Once, more, seated, inour, stage, coach, we, ascended, the, hill, to, the, better, portion, of, the, townwhere, we, passed, through, the, principal, avenue, of, the, place, upon, eachside, of, which, were, arranged, those, pretty, villas, and, gardens, for, whichGeneva, is, so, justly, celebrated, There, were, several, churches, in, view, anda, new, presbyterian, half, built, This, to, us, was, an, interesting, object, atoken, God, was, not, forgotten, by, the, busy, people, below, or, the, wealthyones, around, us, Canandaigua, with, its, lake, and, street, of, villas, received, ourcommendations, There, we, dined, at, a, very, pretty, and, commodious, Hotelhaving, a, fine, view, of, the, lake, from, its, windows, Some, of, the, lake, troutwhich, appeared, upon, the, table, we, found, very, fine, This, lake, is, smallerthan, those, we, have, passed, being, 14, miles, long, The, main, street, is, nearlytwo, miles, long, and, we, drove, through, a, mile, of, tasteful, ‘, gardenhouses’surrounded, by, grounds, laid, out, in, a, pleasing, manner, adorned, withflowers, and, fine, shade, trees, The, country, from, thence, to, Rochester, isvery, beautiful, Spotted, with, farms, and, villages, and, woodlands, coveredwith, groves, of, maple, hickory, basswood, elm, and, evergreen, trees, Itwas, nearly, dark, around, us, when, we, were, told, the, city, was, in, view, andagainst, the, bright, evening, sky, we, beheld, in, the, distance, the, towers, andspires, of, Rochester, When, we, arrived, we44, drove, to, the, Rochester, HouseAfter, some, refreshment, we, bade, our, companions, adieu, promising, to, meetat, an, early, hour, the, next, morning, and, drive, over, the, town, before, we, leftit, for, Lockport, —, and, then, were, glad, to, rest, for, we, had, come, a, longday, ’s, journey, and, in, spite, of, good, roads, and, commodious, coaches, finespirited, horses, and, good, drivers, we, were, very, much, fatigued, Well, do, the, inspired, writers, compare, man, and, his, brief, existence, to, aflower, that, early, withereth, —, to, a, shadow, —, a, cloud, that, quicklyvanisheth, —, one, day, here, and, the, next, gone, Truly, saith, Job, ‘, thine, eyesare, upon, me, and, and, I, am, not, ’, a, just, figure, of, man, ’s, fleeting, lifeNever, have, I, found, the, truth, of, these, comparisons, more, striking, than, atthe, present, moment, I, told, you, of, the, amiable, intellectual, clergymanwho, with, his, daughter, agreed, to, meet, us, early, this, morning, —, when, thatmorning, came, he, was, in, eternity, At, two, o’clock, last, night, we, werearoused, by, a, messenger, from, Miss, T, saying, her, father, was, very, ill, Wefollowed, the, servant, through, the, dark, and, lonely, halls, into, the, chamberwhere, ‘, the, good, man, met, his, fate, ’, Yes, all, was, over, Around, the, room, inattitudes, of, mournful, musing, sat, the, keeper, of, the, Hotel, some, servantsand, several, ladies, who, had, arisen, to, do, all, in, their, power, to, soothe, thesufferer, ’s, pains, All, had, been, done, that, was, possible, but, in, vain, Uponthe, bed, lay, a, silent, corpse, whose, countenance, bespoke, a, death, ofagony, —, it, was, all, that, now, remained, of, that, good, and, kind, old, man, thattender, father, whose, refined, manners, and, intellectual, conversation, hadcharmed, us, so, much, the, day, before, But, his, high, intellect, his, talentshis, agreeable, converse, of, what45, avail, were, they, all, to, him, now, hadthey, not, been, joined, to, deep, heartfelt, piety, and, been, devoted, to, theinterests, of, religion, He, had, died, far, from, his, home, with, no, friendsnear, him, except, his, daughter, —, his, last, hour, passed, away, in, a, hotel, amongstrangers, —, yet, spare, your, sympathy, for, he, died, happy, The, everlastingarms, were, supporting, him, a, tender, father, was, waiting, to, receive, him, inthose, heavenly, mansions, where, death, and, sorrow, can, never, come, He, wasgoing, to, no, unknown, region, he, was, to, meet, no, stranger, face, for, hismind, and, his, heart, had, ever, been, familiar, with, that, celestial, home, nowto, be, his, eternally, —, he, knew, a, welcome, awaited, him, from, that, Savior, andthat, God, with, whose, spirit, he, had, ever, held, communion, through, a, longlife, spent, in, devotion, and, in, acts, of, beneficence, It, was, the, wish, ofthe, celebrated, Archbishop, Leighton, that, he, might, die, at, an, inn, thus, tobe, more, forcibly, reminded, he, was, a, pilgrim, upon, the, earth, —, his, wish, wasfulfilled, for, he, died, at, the, Bell, Inn, London, With, what, terms, of, praise, high, enough, shall, I, speak, of, the, people, ofRochester, When, the, news, of, this, sad, event, spread, they, surrounded, thebereaved, daughter, with, sympathizing, hearts, and, offers, of, service, Thepersons, belonging, to, the, house, and, the, boarders, with, many, physiciansand, clergymen, with, ther, families, were, anxious, to, cheer, the, heart, of, thesad, survivor, and, to, lighten, her, mournful, duties, The, services, of, theEpiscopal, church, were, read, over, the, body, by, the, Rev, Mr, W, a, youngEnglish, clegyman, of, great, talent, and, piety, The, persons, assembled, nearseemed, much, affected, with, this, solemn, event, May, God, bless, this, suddenprovidence, to, them46, and, to, us, Uniting, in, a, procession, we, accompaniedthe, corpse, to, the, canal, boat, where, bidding, adieu, to, Miss, T, we, left, herto, pursue, her, dreary, journey, of, five, hundred, miles, accompanied, onlywith, hired, attendants, With, what, comfort, did, we, see, in, her, the, power, ofreligion, elevating, the, soul, above, the, trials, and, sorrows, of, lifeNothing, else, could, have, supported, this, bereaved, daughter, through, soheartrending, a, dispensation, But, she, knew, in, whom, she, believed, She, sawfrom, whom, the, blow, came, and, her, faith, told, her, it, was, done, in, mercy, Aswe, were, to, leave, Rochester, the, next, morning, some, of, our, kind, friendscalled, that, afternoon, and, insisted, upon, driving, us, through, the, town, Itbeing, our, only, chance, of, seeing, this, celebrated, city, we, accepted, theirkindness, although, the, scenes, of, the, morning, had, unfitted, us, foranything, but, retirement, As, we, drove, along, we, were, astonished, at, the, extent, and, beauty, of, thiscity, It, was, you, know, founded, in, 1812, and, now, contains, 22000inhabitants, We, had, heard, of, its, rapid, rise, but, supposed, it, mustconsist, mostly, of, wooden, buildings, as, is, often, the, case, in, newsettlements, and, our, surprise, was, the, greater, to, find, it, built, in, themost, solid, manner, Churches, houses, hotels, and, banks, court, house, andarcade, markets, were, all, of, marble, or, stone, There, are, here, fourteenchurches2, some, of, them, quite, handsome, The, Episcopal, Church, of, StPaul, ’s, is, a, fine, gothic, edifice, of, grey, stone, —, the, church, which, enjoysthe, ministration, of, the, Rev, Mr, W, mentioned, above, is, also, handsomeof, gothic, form, neatly, edged, with, brown, free, stone, —, the, pres47byterian, isof, grey, plaster, supported, by, substantial, abutments, —, the, baptist, whereMr, C, officiates, one, of, our, active, friends, of, the, morning, a, neatbrick, edifice, —, also, catholic, methodist, and, bethel, for, the, canal, menThe, streets, are, many, of, them, McAdamized, There, is, a, fine, park, heresurrounded, by, neat, railings, where, the, children, of, the, neighborhood, arebrought, to, take, exercise, But, what, most, elicited, our, admiration, were, theprivate, dwellings, which, in, number, and, beauty, are, seldom, equalled, in, ourcities, They, are, spacious, built, of, marble, or, stone, in, gothic, orgrecian, form, surrounded, by, wings, and, piazzas, and, outbuildings, andgrounds, handsomely, laid, out, adorned, with, shade, trees, shrubbery, andflowers, They, are, delightful, retreats, from, the, city, ’s, dust, and, noisemake, fine, playgrounds, for, the, children, and, altogether, evince, much, tasteand, wealth, How, much, better, is, it, for, men, of, fortune, to, secure, forthemselves, and, families, pure, air, and, room, for, exercise, instead, ofsqueezing, as, they, do, in, our, city, into, houses, only, 30, by, 100, feet, asis, too, much, the, custom, in, our, cities, The, wealth, lavished, upon, gayentertainments, would, procure, space, where, their, children, might, gainhealth, and, strength, A, frolic, upon, the, green, sward, is, much, moreconducive, to, health, than, a, sober, city, walk, beside, a, nurse, I, often, seethese, palid, pitiable, little, creatures, in, our, streets, walking, as, gravelyand, demurely, as, some, old, octogenarian, A, child, without, gaiety, is, ascheerless, as, a, landscape, without, sun, The, Genesee, river, divides, the, city, into, two, parts, and, is, crossed, bythree, bridges, and, the, two, aqueducts, of, the, Erie, canal, The, oldest, ofthese, is, a, very, fine, piece, of, hewn, stone, work, 804, feet, long, supported, byeleven, raches, They, were, building, another, aqueduct, which48, is, 858, feetlong, and, 28, in, height3, and, the, music, of, the, rushing, river, was, almostdrowned, by, the, mason, ’s, hammer, Beside, this, canal, there, is, another, called, the, Genesee, valley, canal, fromRochester, to, Olean, 119, miles, The, Genesee, falls, are, very, prettyconsisting, of, rapids, through, the, city, and, in, the, suburbs, it, plungesover, a, circular, rock, into, a, deep, dell, The, whole, fall, through, the, cityis, 268, feet, 97, at, the, cascade, There, is, another, cataract, farther, downthe, river, which, falls, 106, feet, This, is, at, Carthage, two, miles, belowand, here, is, the, port, at, which, the, lake, steamboats, stop, A, rail, road, runsto, this, place, There, was, not, much, water, in, the, river, and, we, did, not, seethe, falls, in, their, greatest, perfection, but, still, there, was, great, beautyin, the, feathery, foam, which, fell, in, snowy, masses, over, the, dark, rockThese, cliffs, are, old, red, stone, and, limestones, —, with, feruginous, sandrock, and, argillaceous, iron, ore, supposed, by, geologists, to, be, equivalentto, the, Caradoc, series, Upon, the, summit, of, the, cliff, opposite, to, us, was, arange, of, solid, stone, mills, from, whence, we, obtain, that, fine, Genesseeflour, ground, from, the, wheat, in, the, fertile, region, around, Five, hundredthousand, barrels, of, flour, are, turned, out, in, a, year, There, are, twentytwoof, these, mills, The, little, streams, which, trickle, down, the, rocks, arestolen, from, the, river, to, turn, the, wheels, Our, kind, friends, were, anxiousto, drive, us, to, Mount, Hope, a, celebrated, cemetery, a, few, miles, from, thecity, but, time, was, wanting, for, this, and, many, other, proposed, pleasures, Adistant, view, of, Lake, Ontario, is, said, to, be, obtained49, from, this, hill, Wereturned, home, through, some, of, the, business, streets, which, particularlyMaine, and, Buffalo, were, filled, with, busy, people, waggons, of, home, orforeign, produce, while, the, long, ranges, of, shops, were, gay, with, dry, goodshanging, from, the, doors, and, piled, with, every, comfort, and, luxury, Stageswere, landing, or, taking, up, passengers, canal, boats, were, arriving, anddeparting, and, every, thing, we, saw, denoted, a, striving, and, thrivingpopulation50, June, 25th, 1840, Dear, E, —, We, left, Rochester, this, morning, at, eight, o’clock, in, a, finestage, and, four, horses, for, Lockport, 64, miles, distant, for, which, we, wereto, pay, two, dollars, and, fifty, cents, each, dinner, on, the, road, includedIt, was, with, much, regret, that, we, parted, from, this, interesting, city, foralthough, we, had, been, there, but, a, short, time, we, had, seen, enough, to, beable, to, appreciate, its, beauties, and, the, sterling, qualities, of, itsbeneficent, and, refined, inhabitants, We, passed, through, several, prettyvillages, and, observed, with, pleasure, the, farm, houses, and, even, themeanest, cabins, were, decorated, with, roses, geraniums, honeysuckles, andother, flowers, a, pleasing, custom, which, I, wish, was, more, followed, amongus, In, one, of, the, villages, I, think, its, name, was, Greece, I, observed, aneat, grave, yard, enclosed, in, a, handsome, stone, fence, and, iron, railingwhere, ‘, the, rude, forefathers, of, the, hamlet, sleep, ’, while, around, the, tombsthe, kind, hand, of, surviving, friends, had, planted, roses, and, droopingwillows, A, great, part51, of, our, way, lay, over, the, famous, ridge, road, anelevation, of, ground, about, as, wide, as, a, common, road, formed, of, sand, andshells, and, which, is, supposed, once, to, have, been, the, shore, of, LakeOntario, now, about, ten, miles, distant, The, ground, has, very, much, thisappearance, as, the, land, between, us, and, the, lake, is, much, lower, and, levelwith, marshy, spots, It, is, in, some, places, covered, with, a, dense, forestThere, is, one, thing, however, which, struck, me, as, singular, the, landdeclines, the, other, side, of, the, road, also, in, some, places, leaving, anarrow, ridge, to, ride, upon, which, is, not, the, ordinary, form, of, a, lakeshore, Why, may, it, not, have, been, a, public, road, formed, by, thatindefatigable, race, of, diggers, the, mound, builders, as, a, thoroughfarebetween, two, of, their, cities, It, might, still, have, been, the, border, of, thelake, but, swampy, and, marshy, ground, If, we, are, to, believe, MrDelafield4, these, people, were, the, descendants, of, the, builders, of, Babeland, when, dispersed, by, the, confusion, of, tongues, wandered, about, the, worldand, at, last, found, themselves, in, America, Here, they, have, thrown, uppyramidial, mounds, in, imitation, of, their, ruined, tower, on, the, plains, ofShinar, The, Arabs, have, a, tradition, that, Nimrod, disappointed, in, hispurpose, of, reaching, heaven, by, building, a, tower, constructed, a, chariotto, which, he, placed, a, pair, of, wings, and, thus, hoped, to, enter, thecelestial, regions, Alas, since, the, days, of, Nimrod, how, many, like, himhave, sought, to, attain, the, courts, above, by, their, own, strenuousexertions, Dear, me, how, I, have, wandered, from, the, ridge, road, The, celebratedtraveller, McKenney, believes, this, to52, have, been, the, border, of, the, lakewhich, broke, away, and, ran, over, the, State, of, New, York, thus, scooping, outthe, earth, at, the, other, side, of, the, ridge, The, lakes, Geneva, CanandaiguaCayuga, etc, he, believes, to, have, been, left, by, this, flood, This, agreeswith, Dr, Mitchell, ’s, theory, of, a, vast, lake, having, been, once, in, this, partof, the, state, which, burst, through, its, southern, shore, at, the, Little, Fallsof, the, Mohawk, and, through, the, Highlands, flooding, the, coasts, of, NewYork, with, alluvion, De, Witt, Clinton, also, in, his, Canal, report, remarks‘The, general, position, of, the, Little, Falls, indicate, the, former, existenceof, a, great, lake, above, connected, with, the, Oneida, lake, as, the, watersforced, a, passage, here, and, receded, the, flats, were, formed, above, composedof, several, acres, of, alluvion, ’, In, this, alluvion, trees, are, often, foundtwelve, feet, under, ground, Darby, observed, marks, upon, the, rocks, at, LittleFalls, fifty, feet, above, the, river, showing, the, water, had, once, stood, sohigh, At, a, distance, we, saw, Brockport, upon, the, canal, and, soon, after, atGainesville, we, dined, We, reached, Lockport, at, five, o’clock, in, theafternoon, and, were, shown, into, a, neat, comfortable, hotel, where, we, awaitedthe, time, of, starting, in, the, cars, Lockport, is, a, town, of, the, mushroomorder, having, arisen, around, the, locks, of, the, canal, within, a, few, yearsThe, churches, houses, and, hotels, looked, very, respectable, and, therailroads, and, canals, gave, it, quite, a, stirring, appearance, The, locks, atthe, canal, here, are, a, great, curiosity, There, are, five, double, combinedlocks, which, carry, the, canal, over, the, ridge, There, is, also, a, deep, cuttingthrough, the, solid, rock, for, some, miles, which, is, very, interesting, Manyspecimens, of, minerals, have, been53, discovered, here, as, carbonate, of, limeselenite, dogtooth, spar, petrifactions, etc, I, promised, to, give, you, anaccount, of, all, our, expenses, so, I, will, mention, now, we, are, to, payninetyfour, cents, each, to, Niagara, twenty, miles, as, I, shall, not, think, ofsuch, mundane, affairs, while, there, Our, expenses, at, the, hotels, have, beentwo, dollars, a, day, each, and, meals, fifty, cents, each, at, all, our, stoppingplaces, Seated, in, the, rail, car, we, were, soon, on, our, road, and, fastdashing, through, a, tolerably, cultivated, country, with, several, neatmansions, peeping, through, the, trees, I, trembled, lest, the, land, shouldremain, thus, until, we, arrived, at, Niagara, for, I, could, not, bear, toapproach, it, through, petty, villages, and, farms, but, we, soon, left, allcultivation, behind, and, found, ourselves, in, a, deep, forest, While, glidingrapidly, along, the, engineer, ’s, bell, rang, to, scare, some, cow, or, otheranimal, as, we, thought, from, the, rail, track, Several, of, the, passengerslooked, out, one, pronouncing, it, a, man, another, a, cow, until, as, weapproached, we, discovered, it, was, an, Indian, female, She, was, enveloped, ina, dark, mantle, from, beneath, which, could, be, seen, her, scarlet, legginsrichly, embroidered, with, beads, With, a, slow, and, stately, step, she, pacedthe, railtrack, the, engineer, ’s, bell, and, shrill, whistle, unheeded, Thatshe, heard, them, was, evident, for, another, Indian, woman, her, companion, whowalked, outside, the, rail, stretched, forth, her, hand, as, if, in, earnestappeal, but, the, haughty, young, princess, scorned, to, fly, before, hercountry, ’s, foe, The, engine, with, slackened, speed, came, near, her, andstopped, then, and, not, until, it, had, quite, stopped, she, condescended, towalk, off, the, railway, As, we, passed, I, saw, she, was, young, and, pretty, andher, dark, eye, flashed, with, a54, triumphant, expression, which, said, ‘, Youdared, not, drive, over, me, I, scorned, to, be, forced, from, the, road, by, yourbell, like, an, animal, ’, ‘, Look, out, for, the, Falls, Prepare, for, Niagara, ’, is, the, cry, of, all, in, thecoach, My, heart, began, to, beat, —, does, not, yours, Do, be, a, little, romanticand, feel, some, emotion, while, about, to, behold, one, of, Nature, ’s, greatestwonders, I, looked, out, we, were, on, the, river, ’s, bank, a, high, precipice, ofabout, two, hundred, feet, Far, below, rushed, the, river, of, a, green, copperhue, or, verdigris, far, up, through, the, defile, I, caught, a, view, of, amountain, of, mist, but, I, resolutely, turned, away, for, such, snatches, ofviews, I, have, been, told, to, avoid, as, bringing, disappointment, with, themThe, road, swerved, from, the, river, and, in, a, few, minutes, we, found, ourselvesin, the, midst, of, the, little, village, of, Niagara, When, the, train, stopped, wewere, surrounded, by, a, host, of, porters, struggling, to, secure, us, for, theirseveral, favorite, hotels, We, chose, the, Cataract, house, from, a, friend’srecommendation, and, from, its, appropriate, name, We, had, no, cause, to, repentour, decision, as, its, accommodation, and, attendance, were, every, thing, wecould, wish, We, were, shown, into, a, neat, chamber, which, to, my, delightlooked, out, upon, the, rushing, rapids, The, tea, bell, rang, as, we, entered, andmuch, to, the, annoyance, of, my, impatient, spirit, my, companion, made, it, plainto, me, I, should, refresh, myself, before, visiting, the, Falls, Tea, over, I, hadleave, to, go, and, we, were, soon, upon, the, pathway, Shall, I, take, you, at, onceinto, the, presence, chamber, of, the, divinity, or, shall, I, describe, the, hallsand, corridors, as, I, pass, through, them, to, her, throne, I, think, a, minutedescription, will, best, please, you, Niagara, river, just55, before, it, reachesthe, fall, is, divided, into, two, parts, one, rushing, past, the, Canada, shoreplunges, over, the, rocks, making, the, crescent, or, horseshoe, fall, —, thisfall, is, about, one, hundred, and, sixty, feet, high, The, other, half, of, theriver, passes, around, an, island, called, Goat, or, Iris, island, and, fallsfrom, the, American, side, This, island, has, been, sacred, from, the, foot, of, manuntil, a, few, years, since, when, a, bridge, was, thrown, across, the, rapids, withmuch, dexterity, and, daring, Upon, this, bridge, we, will, walk, if, you, pleasestopping, one, moment, to, view, the, rapids, These, constitute, a, verybeautiful, feature, of, the, scene, and, were, it, not, for, the, falls, would, bewell, worth, a, visit, on, their, own, account, The, river, is, a, mile, wide, andcomes, rushing, and, foaming, over, rocks, some, ten, or, twelve, feet, highlooking, seafaring, men, tell, us, very, much, like, breakers, or, a, sea, in, astorm, —, the, green, waves, heightening, the, illusion, One, is, glad, to, besafely, over, this, tumultuous, water, especially, as, the, former, bridge, hasbeen, carried, away, From, the, bridge, you, land, upon, Bath, island, containingabout, two, acres, of, land, upon, which, is, erected, a, tollhouse, and, shopfor, the, sale, of, Indian, curiosities, and, canes, There, are, also, bathinghouses, here, A, short, bridge, brings, us, to, Goat, Island, onehalf, a, milelong, and, a, quarter, wide, It, is, also, called, Iris, and, as, such, I, shalldesignate, it, The, increased, roar, the, mist, rising, above, the, trees, urgeyou, on, and, you, pass, the, ‘, curiosity, shop, ’, and, refreshments, here, offeredand, hasten, on, through, many, a, winding, forest, path, until, you, gain, theopposite, side, of, the, island, where, you, find, yourself, upon, the, brink, of, adeep, gulf, into, which, an, ocean, broken, loose, from, its, bounds, isprecipitated, with, astounding, noise, and, violence56, This, is, thecrescent, fall, on, the, Canadian, shore, But, linger, not, here, Descend, theisland, to, the, brink, of, the, river, and, cross, the, rapids, over, a, totteringfrail, bridge, to, the, tower, which, stands, upon, the, precipice, at, the, edgeof, the, falls, Ascend, to, the, top, and, lean, over, the, railing, look, calmlydown, if, you, can, into, the, fathomless, abyss, of, ocean, where, the, waves, aredashing, the, foam, whirling, and, the, winds, rushing, amid, the, roar, of, athousand, thunders, eternally, ascending, Deafened, confounded, bewilderedyou, retreat, in, haste, fearful, every, moment, the, breakers, which, aredashing, against, the, tower, will, tear, it, away, from, its, foundation, andplunge, you, into, the, fearful, ocean, depths, below, At, this, place, and, upontable, rock, opposite, you, see, Niagara, in, all, its, power, and, terror, But, ifyou, would, behold, it, in, all, its, ravishing, beauty, you, must, go, as, we, didthe, next, morning, before, sunrise, and, view, it, from, the, ferry, house, Toreach, this, spot, you, do, not, cross, to, Iris, island, but, follow, the, riverbank, to, the, American, fall, near, which, is, the, ferryman, ’s, cottage, and, ata, little, distance, the, ladder, which, leads, you, down, to, the, boat, Seatedupon, a, rock, in, front, of, the, cottage, we, feasted, our, eyes, with, unearthlybeauty, Beside, you, is, the, American, fall, tinged, with, a, delicate, apple, orberyl, green, hue, One, delights, to, follow, with, the, eye, this, fairtranslucent, arch, as, it, plunges, far, down, into, the, water, nearly, twohundred, feet, below, us, You, have, but, a, sideling, view, of, this, fall, hereLooking, past, it, you, see, the, dark, foliage, of, Iris, island, and, beyond, theCanadian, fall, This, immense, mass, of, water, falls, over, rocks, in, the, formof, a, crescent, and, is, tinted, with, an, elysian, loveliness, which, you, havenever, beheld, and, never, can57, conceive, let, me, write, pages, upon, it, Earthhas, never, produced, water, of, the, like, hue, something, of, the, emerald, butmore, rich, more, vivid, This, green, spotted, and, embroidered, as, it, iswith, wreaths, of, snow, white, foam, presents, the, most, charming, and, uniqueeffect, imaginable, In, some, places, the, water, pitches, over, perfectlysmooth, as, if, an, emerald, arch, and, so, pellucid, that, you, may, distinctlysee, through, it, the, white, foam, that, is, churned, from, the, rocks, over, whichit, flows, As, we, reached, the, spot, from, whence, this, is, seen, the, sun, aroseabove, the, trees, and, immediately, two, glorious, rainbows, spanned, the, riverfrom, shore, to, shore, and, the, mist, which, was, rising, high, in, the, air, tookthe, tint, of, the, rose, which, faded, only, to, be, replaced, by, the, mostgorgeous, prismatic, hues, Never, had, imagination, pictured, any, thing, soglorious, as, that, scene, a, tremendous, fall, of, green, and, white, water, agay, colored, rainbow, rosy, mist, azure, sky, and, shores, of, various, shadesIt, was, a, creation, which, belonged, not, to, earth, It, seemed, as, if, thecelestial, city, was, before, us, with, its, gates, and, walls, of, sapphire, ofemerald, of, ruby, and, of, gold, The, waters, of, life, that, flow, through, thecity, of, God, seemed, rushing, past, us, for, the, scene, was, altogetherunearthly, and, our, feelings, were, elevated, to, that, sublime, architect, whocould, create, such, surpassing, beauty, Earth, and, its, cares, home, and, itsjoys, are, all, forgotten, and, we, feel, as, if, we, could, ever, recline, beforethe, throne, of, that, mysterious, presence, and, watch, untiring, those, cloudsof, incense, which, are, rising, before, it, forever, When, we, left, the, scenewe, trod, in, solemn, silence, as, if, on, holy, ground, The, violence, with, whichthe, water, pours, over, the, rocks, has, worn, them, away58, and, the, river, hasbroken, its, way, up, from, Lake, Ontario, at, the, rate, of, a, rood, in, threeyears, It, is, supposed, when, first, discovered, to, have, been, near, theClifton, House, on, the, Canadian, shore, and, the, ferry, house, at, theAmerican, June, 26th, —, This, morning, we, descended, the, cliffs, by, a, staircase, andcrossed, to, the, Canadian, shore, The, boat, was, tossed, about, like, a, shellupon, the, whirling, waves, and, as, they, looked, up, at, the, mass, of, watertumbling, so, near, them, and, at, the, boiling, water, two, hundred, and, fiftyfeet, deep, under, us, some, of, our, fellow, passengers, became, a, littlenervous, My, whole, soul, was, so, absorbed, in, contemplating, the, wondrousscene, that, I, felt, no, terror, A, sentinel, in, the, scotch, costume, greetedour, eyes, when, we, landed, telling, us, we, were, now, in, a, strange, land, amonganother, people, A, winding, walk, up, the, cliff, leads, you, to, Clifton, Housea, celebrated, Canadian, hotel, From, the, balconies, of, this, house, is, one, ofthe, most, imposing, views, of, the, Niagara, falls, You, see, the, whole, at, oncewhile, from, the, American, side, you, see, only, a, part, at, a, time, Still, ifnot, so, grand, the, view, is, more, varied, and, more, beautiful, upon, theopposite, shore, and, from, Iris, Island, Every, one, says, it, is, ridiculous, toattempt, to, describe, these, falls, but, I, have, promised, to, give, youdaguerreotype, views, and, will, endeavor, to, sketch, the, outlines, —, theshading, and, the, impressions, of, the, scene, can, only, be, given, by, theplace, itself, Imagine, a, crescent, of, water, a, mile, long, plunging, withawful, violence, as, if, the, foundations, of, the, great, deep, had, broken, upagain, from, a, cliff, nearly, 200, feet, high, According, to, McKenney15000000, tons, of, water59, are, poured, over, the, rocks, in, 24, hours, A, greenisland, divides, this, fall, into, two, unequal, parts, Table, rock, upon, theCanadian, shore, is, at, the, edge, of, the, falls, and, projects, over, the, cliffwhere, you, may, stand, with, nothing, between, you, and, the, boiling, oceanbelow, So, close, is, it, to, the, water, that, the, waves, wash, over, part, of, itand, it, is, almost, always, covered, with, mist, and, spray, If, it, be, glory, tobe, buried, in, Niagara, you, may, here, hope, for, that, fate, as, a, portion, ofthe, rock, has, already, fallen, and, a, large, crack, shows, you, the, remainderwill, soon, follow, From, this, spot, is, said, to, be, the, finest, view, as, theeye, embraces, the, whole, circle, of, waters, but, as, it, was, one, of, the, dayswhen, the, mist, takes, that, direction, I, saw, but, little, of, this, I, foundmyself, upon, a, slippery, rock, a, shelf, between, heaven, and, earth, withwaves, of, spray, breaking, over, me, and, a, furious, mist, dashing, into, myface, —, a, noise, of, waters, was, in, my, ears, a, white, foam, rushed, wildly, pastand, I, felt, as, if, caught, up, in, the, sky, in, a, whirlwind, and, driving, snowstorm, We, waded, back, through, the, wet, grass, and, ran, into, the, Pavilion, toavoid, the, spray, dripping, from, the, eaves, This, house, besides, being, acuriosity, shop, is, the, residence, of, the, guide, who, will, conduct, you, down, along, staircase, and, behind, the, fall, if, you, wish, —, as, I, had, no, penchantfor, being, drenched, half, drowned, and, suffocated, I, did, not, attempt, thisexploit, We, descended, this, morning, the, American, side, and, ventured, alittle, behind, that, fall, One, feels, very, much, as, an, Israelite, making, hisexode, with, a, wall, of, water, at, his, side, ‘, where, the, flood, stoodupright, ’, When, once, in, you, see, a, glorious, chamber, with, dome, and, walls, of, emeraldrendered, transparent, by60, the, morning, sun, You, might, imagine, yourself, inone, of, those, crystal, caves, where, the, sea, nymphs, congregate, beneath, thearches, of, the, sea, On, the, road, from, table, rock, to, Clifton, House, thereis, another, building, where, there, is, a, fine, museum, containing, 4000specimens, of, Indian, curiosities, animals, minerals, c, many, of, themfrom, that, region, The, trees, about, here, are, most, of, them, evergreen, Theregular, yellow, pine, grows, here, and, the, silver, fir, with, its, white, linedleaves, and, purple, cones, and, the, fan, leaved, larch, growing, 100, feet, highThe, rocks, of, Niagara, are, secondary, limestone, and, sandstone, aboundingwith, veins, and, nodules, of, various, minerals, —, among, them, selenitecalcareous, spar, —, petrifactions, —, tufa, from, the, cave, and, many, others, Ibelieve, I, have, sketched, for, you, every, thing, regarding, thesefalls, —, gigantesque, phenomene, as, La, Vaseur, calls, them, Still, I, do, notexpect, to, give, you, any, idea, of, them, for, no, one, who, ever, wrote, conveyedan, impression, of, the, reality, to, me, I, might, make, a, pyramid, ofexpletives, and, when, all, the, superbs, beautiful, ’s, majestic, ’s, andtouching, ’s, are, expended, you, will, say, when, you, come, ‘, the, half, has, neverbeen, told, me, ’, Many, have, been, disappointed, here, chiefly, because, thescenery, around, the, falls, is, not, as, imposing, as, they, had, imagined, Somewould, have, a, range, of, lofty, mountains, as, a, back, scene, or, a, crest, ofnaked, rocks, towering, above, the, falls, but, I, fancy, these, are, of, the, classof, contradictionists, who, make, a, respectable, figure, in, conversationmerely, by, opposing, every, thing, They, thus, obtain, a, hearing, are, able, toenter, into, an, argument, when, no, other, means, would, gain, them, a, listenerHe, who, formed, this, imposing, scene, is, a, better, judge61, of, the, sublime, andbeautiful, A, range, of, mountains, would, materially, injure, the, effect, asit, would, by, contrast, take, away, from, the, height, of, the, water, Thecataract, would, be, a, secondary, object, but, seated, as, it, is, in, a, levelregion, of, country, it, is, the, first, object, that, strikes, the, eye, —, a, gemon, natures, forehead, There, are, many, drives, in, this, neighborhood, tovarious, interesting, places, such, as, springs, whirlpools, battlefieldsc, The, parade, ground, is, also, a, favorite, place, of, resort, A, regiment, of700, soldiers, are, reviewed, upon, the, Canadian, shore, We, hired, a, carriageat, the, Clifton, House, and, after, a, short, drive, found, ourselves, upon, abeautiful, plain, above, the, falls, surrounded, by, guard, houses, andbarracks, The, plain, was, soon, filled, with, soldiers, who, came, marching, upin, separate, detachments, from, every, direction, They, were, tall, fine, formedmen, all, of, one, height, dressed, in, the, Scotch, costume, consisting, of, theshort, plaid, skirt, stockings, laced, with, red, cap, and, a, cloud, of, blackplumes, They, were, well, drilled, and, marched, countermarched, and, wentthrough, all, their, evolutions, as, one, man, The, dress, is, picturesque, butmust, be, a, cold, one, in, these, regions, A, pantaloon, over, the, naked, knee, Ithink, would, be, an, improvement, I, could, see, soldiers, although, not, aswell, drilled, at, home, so, I, was, glad, to, turn, my, course, towards, thatrolling, flood, below, From, this, plain, is, a, fine, view, of, the, rapids, abovethe, cataract, and, of, Iris, Island, which, seems, to, have, floated, to, thebrink, of, the, precipice, like, one, of, the, Mexican, floating, islands, Wespent, the, afternoon, upon, Iris, island, In, the, little, curiosity, shop, werefreshed, ourselves, with, delicate, white, strawberries, grown, upon, theisland, covered62, with, rich, cream, Here, also, we, added, to, our, stock, ofIndian, bags, and, moccasins, Among, the, articles, in, the, shops, at, thevillage, I, admired, most, a, large, living, eagle, which, was, chained, to, hisperch, His, feathers, were, black, and, white, and, his, beak, and, claws, yellowwith, a, ruff, of, grey, about, his, neck, I, pitied, the, poor, captive, as, hestood, gazing, sadly, out, apparently, listening, to, the, roar, of, the, fallsand, longing, to, be, at, large, in, his, native, forest, once, more, The, village, of, Tuscarora, Indians, is, sometimes, visited, much, againsttheir, wishes, however, The, Indian, nations, have, never, lost, the, remembranceof, their, former, power, and, their, present,

were, only, surrounded, by, ploughed, fields, soon, returned, to, thecoach, where, I, busied, myself, in, writing, the, above, Pray, read, on, if, it, isonly, to, repay, me, for, my, sufferings,

turned, out, and, placed, inour, coaches, to, the, Niagara, end, of, which, their, horses, were, fastenedThey, looked, very, sourly, at, us, while, this, was, passing, thinking, perhapsof, the, maxim, of, Pythagoras, to, his, scholars, —, Do, not, remain, in, thehighway, They, wondered, at, us, for, sitting, in67, their, highway, deprivingthem, of, their, engine, and, condemning, them, to, the,

would, be, quite, a, loss, A, joyous, shout, announced, the, appearance, of, our, horses, and, we, were, soonon, our, way, again, We, passed, through, Black, Rock, a, considerable, villageand, then, followed, the, Erie, canal, for, some, distance, The, last, two, mileswere, upon, the, borders, of, Lake, Erie, which, stretched, away, a, mighty, mass, ofgreen, waters, to, the, horizon, As, this, was, our, first, view, of, our, great‘inland, seas, we, gazed, upon, it, with, much, interest, There, are, manyhandsome, villas, in, the, vicinity, of, the, town, commanding, fine, views, of, thelake, and, city, one, of, them, a, large, Gothic, stone, mansion, promises, to, bequite, an, ornament, to, the, country, if, ever, finished, At, Buffalo, we, droveof, course, to, the, American, Hotel, as,

reported, to, be, very, wretchedThere, are, about, 25000, boatmen, and, sailors, employed, upon, the, canal, andin, lake, navigation, who, were, of, the, lowest, and, most, worthless, class, ofmen, seeming, inaccessible, to, all, efforts, for, their, reformation, orconversion, These, mixing, with, the, lower, population, of, Buffalo, andother, towns, on, their, route, exerted, a, baneful, influence, The, BethelUnion, attempted, to, send, missionaries, among, them, but, they, were, abusedinsulted, and, almost, discouraged, Still, as, they, felt, it, their, dutythese, selfdenying, men, persevered, every, Sunday, in, addressing, the, menalong, the, canal, and, in, presenting, bibles, and, tracts, They, soon, beganhowever, to, have, some, hope, for, when, the, canal, closed, last, autumn, therewere, only, two, men, who, had, re69fused, tracts, and, only, three, who, insultedthem, With, this, success, small, as, it, was, they, were, excited, to, go, onhoping, the, Lord, was, smiling, upon, their, labors, The, minister, mostsuccessful, among, them, had, once, been, a, canal, boy, himself, and, whilesitting, upon, his, horse, dragging, the, boat, employed, himself, for, hours, ininventing, new, and, strange, oaths, to, surprise, his, fellow, boatmen, The, mennow, readily, listened, to, him, They, were, conscious, of, their, degradationknew, they, were, despised, by, all, good, men, and, never, hoped, to, rise, Seeingnow, one, of, their, number, so, bright, and, shining, a, light, they, trusted, aboatman, ’s, name, would, not, always, be, an, object, of, scorn, These, poor, mencomplained, to, him, that, they, had, no, day, of, rest, as, there, was, as, muchforwarding, upon, the, Sabbath, as, upon, any, other, day, The, Captains, of, thelake, boats, were, also, obliged, to, struggle, against, this, evil, and, in, someinstances, had, renounced, their, trade, upon, that, account, or, uponremonstrance, had, been, turned, adrift, for, some, less, scrupulous, CaptainThe, fault, then, seems, to, lie, upon, the, forwarding, merchants, whom, MrStillwell, addressed, begging, their, forbearance, in, this, respect, It, is, to, be, hoped, this, address, produced, its, intended, effect, and, themerchants, who, claim, a, day, of, repose, for, themselves, have, granted, thesame, to, the, unfortunate, boatmen6, June, 29, —, This, morning, we,

true, lost, some, of, her, original, brightness, erethus, fallen, for, she, had, been, twentythree, years, under, water, havingbeen, sunk, in, a, naval, fight, on, Lake, Erie, and, lately, raised, The, wharveswere, loaded, with, produce, and, merchandize, while, carts, boats, and, menwere, loading, and, being, unloaded, We, left, Buffalo, with, regret, Its, majestic, river, and, noble, lake, —, its, background, of, forests, gay, streets, and, social, people, have, left, a, vivid, andpleasing, picture, upon, our, memories, A, fine, pier, or, breakwater, as, theycall, it, of, solid, mason,

They, aregenerally, built, very, strong, to, resist, the, waves, that, run, high, here, Thecomplement, of, men, for, one, of, these, boats, amounts, to, 40, the, captainreceiving, 100, a, month, After, an, excellent, dinner, we, ascended, to, thepromenade, deck, which, like, our, Hudson, river, boats, is, the, uppermost, decksurrounded, with, seats, We, were, out, upon, lake, Erie, and, gazed, around, uswith, wonder, and, delight, The, water, was, a, fine, dark, green, which, as, thewind, was, high, was, tossed, in, waves, crested, with, white, foam, or, sparklingspray, The, shores, were, in, some, places, low, and, wooded, alternating, withgentle, elevations, at, whose, foot, ran, a, line, of, yellow, sand, —, a, sky, ofpurest, azure, dotted, with, fleecy, clouds, was, above, What, a, lovely, scene, —, asks, Sir, Walter, This, lake, however, is, rather, larger, than, his, Scottishlake, it, being, 290, miles, long, It, has, the, character, of, being, the, mosttempestuous, of, all, the, lakes, a, fact, we, were, soon, able, to, verify, for, inthe, afternoon, the, wind, increased, to, a, gale, and, the78, waves, dashingagainst, our, vessel, gave, us, each, time, a, shock, as, if, she, had, struck, arock, The, ladies, soon, began, to, feel, the, effects, of, such, tossing, and, one, afteranother, retired, to, their, berths, quite, ill, Fortyfive, miles, from, Buffalowe, stopped, at, the, town, of, Dunkirk, which, is, the, termination, of, the, NewYork, and, Erie, rail, road, It, commences, at, Hudson, river, 25, miles, above, thecity, of, New, York, a, distance, of, 450, miles, from, its, end, This, town, underthese, circumstances, is, rising, rapidly, It, has, a, fine, circular, bayhaving, two, projecting, points, which, protect, it, one, and, a, half, milesacross, —, and, is, one, of, the, best, harbors, upon, the, lake, There, is, also, apier, within, the, shelter, of, which, five, large, schooners, were, moored, Weobserved, a, rail, road,

four, cents, aquart, Here, we, landed, a, passenger, an, inhabitant, of, Dunkirk, who, duringthe, voyage, had, been, vaunting, the, advantages, of, his, town, The, day, wouldsoon, come, he, said, when, he, should, no, longer, resort, to, Buffalo, for, hisgoods, as, the, new, rail, road, would, bring, all, the, trade, to, DunkirkDarkness, drove, us, to, our, state, room, which, we, found, replete, with, everyconvenience, —, a, circumstance, much, to, our, satisfaction, as, we, were, to, spenda, week, in, it, ere, we, reached, our, destined, haven, I, would, recommend, you, ifyou, ever, travel, this, way, to, choose, as, we, did, a, state, cabin, lookingtowards, the, shore, for, these, boats, stop, at, every, considerable, town, andof, course, keep, near, the, coast, In, consequence, of, this, arrangement, wecould, if, inclined, sit, in, our, cabin, and, through, the, open, door, or79window, behold, the, scenery, at, our, ease, while, those, upon, the, oppositeside, gazed, out, upon, an, uniform, waste, of, waters, without, a, shore, I, thusobtained, a, sight, of, the, town, of, Erie, where, we, stopped, during, the, nightAroused, by, the, noise, I, looked, from, my, window, and, saw, the, towndistinctly, by, clear, starlight, This, town, is, in, Pennsylvania, and, is, thetermination, of, the, Pittsburg, and, Erie, canal, In, the, canal, basin, besidecanal, boats, I, saw, a, large, steamboat, and, several, schooners, Presque, Isledefends, the, harbor, There, was, a, large, hotel, brightly, illuminated, andsome, stage, coaches, awaiting, the, arrival, of, passengers,

the, revered, La, Fayette, wasfeted, It, was, formed, into, a, large, tent, by, sails, and, flags, which, hadwaved, in, the, battle, upon, the, lake, under, which, was, a, fine, collationSeveral,

we, observed, a, ship, at, anchornear, the, shore, quite, a, picturesque, object, It, proved, to, be, theMilwaukie, a, ship, of, three, hundred, tons, burthen, bound, from, Buffalo, toChicago, It,

Detroitthrough, the, winter, The, country, upon, the, Canadian, shore, is, wild, anduninhabited, while, the, Michigan, side, of, the, river, is, frequently, adornedwith, fields, of, grass, or, wheat, or, thrifty, orchards, The, houses, areplain, but, seemed, surrounded, by, every, comfort, Our, course, ran, quite, nearthis, shore, so, close, that, I, might, fancy, myself, transported, into,

Canadian, shore, my, eyes, were, attracted, by, what, seemed, a, row, ofhaystacks, I, enquired, the, meaning, and, was, told, I, was, looking, upon, anIndian, village, and, these, were, wigwams, I, was, delighted, to, behold, averitable, Indian, lodge, and, to, see, real, Indians, instead, of, thosehalf96, civilized, beings, I, had, met, at, Niagara, They, are, a, body, ofChippeway, Indians,

werefurnished, with, another, evidence, of, the, rise, of, these, waters, An, officer, of, the, army, and, his, wife, were, our, fellow99, voyagers, veryintelligent, and, agreeable, persons, They,

acquaintance, from, New, York, Thesemeetings, in, a, distant, land, are, very, interesting, carrying, our, feelingsat, once, to, the, home, we, had, left, This, steamboat, is, one, of, the, largestupon, the, lakes, is, finished, in, a, style, of, great100, elegance, and, is, saidto, be, as, long, as, the, English, steamship, of, the, same, name, This, whole, day, since, ten, o’clock, —, we, have, been, passing, through, Huronunder, a, cloudless, sky, The, lake, is, two, hundred, and, fiftyfive, mileslong, and, its, waters, are, of, a, deeper, tint, than, those, we, have, passedowing, to, its, great, depth, as, we, are, sailing, over, nine, hundred, feet, ofwater, while, in, some, places, it, is, said, to, be, unfathomable, The, color, isa, dark, olive, almost, black, and, it, is, only, when, the, sun, shines, throughthe, waves, that, we, can, perceive, they, are, green, The, cause, of, the, variouscolors, of, water, has, produced, many, a, hypothesis, Sir, Humphry, Davy, tellsus, the, primitive, color, of, water, is, like, the, sky, a, delicate, azure13He, says, ‘, the, finest, water, is, that, which, falls, from, the, atmosphere, —, thiswe, can, rarely, obtain, in, its, pure, state, as, all, artificial, contact, givesmore, or, less, of, contamination, but, in, snow, melted, by, the, sunbeamsthat, has, fallen, upon, glaciers, themselves, formed, from, frozen, snow, maybe, regarded, as, in, its, state, of, greatest, purity, Congelation, expels, bothsalt, and, air, from, water, whether, existing, below, or, formed, in, theatmosphere, and, in, the, high, and, uninhabited, region, of, glaciers, therecan, scarcely, be, any, substances, to, contaminate, Removed, from, animal, andvegetable, life, they, are, even, above, the, mineral, kingdom, ’, Water, frommelted, snow, then, considered, as, the, purest, Sir, Humphrey, goes, on, todescribe, its, color, ‘, When, a, mass, is, seen, through, it, is, a, bright, blueand, according, to, its, greater, or, less, depth, of, substance, it, has, more, orless, of, this, color, ’, ‘, In, general, when, examining, lakes, and, masses, ofwater, in, high, mountains, their101, color, is, the, same, bright, azure, CaptParry, states, that, water, in, the, Polar, ice, has, the, like, beautiful, tint’The, brown, green, and, other, colors, of, rivers, he, imputes, to, substancesover, which, they, flow, as, peat, bogs, vegetable, and, mineral, substances, Heallows, the, sea, can, not, be, colored, from, any, thing, upon, the, bottom, butimputes, the, tint, to, the, infusion, of, iodine, and, brome, which, he, hasdetected, in, sea, water, the, result, of, decayed, marine, vegetables, Of, thisprimitive, water, are, our, lakes, formed, originating, as, they, do, in, regionsof, snow, and, ice, Lake, Superior, from, whence, they, flow, is, a, vast, basinof, trap, rock, of, volcanic, origin14, It, is, the, most, magnificent, body, ofwater, in, the, world, five, hundred, miles, long, and, nine, hundred, deep, andperfectly, pellucid, Into, this, pure, and, originally, azure, primitivewater, there, flow, forty, rivers, upon, the, south, side, alone, according, toMr, McKenney, of, the, Indian, department, who, counted, this, number, from, StMary, ’s, to, the, river, St, Louis, These, rivers, he, tells, us, are, all, ambercolored, Why, then, may, not, these, yellow, rivers, flowing, into, blue, waterproduce, green, You, see, I, like, to, hazard, a, hypothesis, as, well, asothers, I, hope, you, will, not, call, this, absurd, Col, McKenney, himselfimputes, the, green, color, to, reflection, of, the, ‘, rays, of, light, passingthrough, the, foliage, of, the, shores, conveying, their, own, green, hue, untothe, surface, of, the, water, from, which, they, are, reflected, ’, This, might, bethe, case, in, small, rivers, or, lakes, but, it, can, not, thus, tint, such, a, vastextent, of, water, A, writer, in, the, American, Journal, of, Science, is, ofopinion, the, color, of, water, is, reflected, from, the, sky, and, is, blue, dullblack, or102, golden, as, the, sky, may, be, —, and, that, ‘, green, is, produced, inwater, by, the, yellow, light, of, the, sun, mixed, with, the, cerulean, bluethrough, which, it, shines, ’, On, the, contrary, the, Count, Xavier, deMaistre15, does, not, impute, the, color, of, water, to, any, infusedsubstance, nor, to, reflection, from, above, but, reflection, from, the, surfacebelow, ‘, as, the, blue, color, of, the, sky, is, owing, to, reflection, from, theearth, beneath, ’, ‘, Limpid, waters, when, they, have, sufficient, depth, ’, saysthe, Count, reflect, like, air, a, blue, color, from, below, —, and, this, arisesfrom, a, mixture, of, air, which, water, always, contains, to, a, greater, orlesser, amount, This, blue, color, being, the, primitive, hue, of, water, issometimes, clouded, or, lost, by, earthy, infusion, or, reflections, from, acolored, sky, The, green, tinge, which, he, sometimes, observed, in, water, hetells, us, is, occasioned, by, reflection, from, a, white, surface, below, Thishe, proves, by, his, experiment, of, a, sheet, of, tin, painted, white, let, downbeneath, the, water, —, and, his,

Zappa, river, soon, afterentering, the, lake, there, is, a, cabin, where, a, woodman, resides, in, thesummer, season, to, supply, the, steamboats, and, at, Presque, Isle, where, westopped, in, the, afternoon, there, is, another, cluster, of, cabins, andwoodpiles, Our, Captain, did, not, stop, at, this, latter, place, as, he, did, notlike, their, wood, it, being, chiefly, swamp, ash, The, shore,

against, the, clear, blue, sky, The, island, of, Michilimackinac, orMackinaw, or, Mackinac, as, it, is, commonly, spelt, and, pronounced, is, a, highand, bold, bluff, of, limestone, about, three, hundred, feet, above, the, watercovered, with, verdure, Its, name, signifies, in, the, Indian, tongue, greatturtle, as, it, is, something, of, the, figure, of, this, animal, At, the, foot, ofthe, bluff, are, strewed, the, buildings, of, the, town, Among, the, mostconspicuous, of, these, are, the, agency, house, and, gardens, residence, of, MrSchoolcraft, Indian, Agent, —, and, the, church, and, mission, house, Along, thebeach, were, several, Indian, wigwams, while, numerous, pretty, bark, canoeswere, going, and, coming, as, this, is, the, Indian, stopping, place, A, verybeautiful, and, conspicuous, object, was, the, United, States, fort, presentingat, a, distance108, the, appearance, of, a, long, white, line, of, buildingsinserted, into, the, top, of, the, island, high, above, the, town, As, weapproached, its, picturesque, blockhouses, and, the, pretty, balconiedresidences, of, the, officers, came, out, to, view, having, the, banner, of, the‘stripes, and, stars, ’, waving, over, them, While, gazing, at, this, fair, picturesuddenly, a, brilliant, flame, and, volumes, of, white, smoke, arose, above, thefort, while, a, booming, sound, told, us, they, were, firing, their, middaysalute, in, honor, of, the, day, This, added, much, to, the, beauty, and, grandeurof, the, scene, As, our, boat, was, to, remain, there, for, some, hours, wedisembarked, and, ascended, to, the, fort, to, visit, our, friends, the, commandingofficer, and, his, family, We, found, them, sitting, upon, their, balconylooking, down, upon, the, newly, arrived, steamboat, After, the, first, greetingsand, mutual, enquiries, were, over, we, were, shown, all, it, was, thought, wouldinterest, us, The, view, from, our, friend, ’s, balcony, was, beautiful, in, the, extreme, The, bayin, front, the, lovely, islands, around, covered, with, a, luxuriousvegetation, —, the, town, spread, out, at, our, feet, —, the, Indian, lodges, and, thecanoes, skimming, the, bright, waters, each, called, forth, our, expressions, ofadmiration, Passing, into, the, interior, of, the, fort, and, through, the, fineparade, ground, and, a, large, gateway, we, found, ourselves, upon, the, summit, ofthe, island, Our, path, lay, through, copses, of, white, birch, maple, andvarious, other, trees, and, over, green, sward, covered, with, strawberries, anda, variety, of, wild, flowers, Our, friends, kindly, gathered, for, me, a, varietyof, these, among, which, was, a, fine, scarlet, lilium, superbum, blue, bellsand, kinni, kanic, or, Indian, tobacco, and, a, pretty, plant, called, Indianstrawberry, Suddenly109, the, silver, tones, of, woman, ’s, voice, sounded, nearand, in, a, fairy, dell, we, came, upon, a, tent, surrounded, by, a, party, of, ladiesand, gentlemen, busily, engaged, preparing, for, a, fete, in, honor, of, the, dayAmong, them, was, the, daughter, of, our, host, and, some, of, the, celebratedfamily, of, S, ——, t, We, were, presented, to, the, party, and, were, quitechagrined, our, limited, time, would, not, permit, us, to, accept, theirinvitation, to, remain, and, partake, of, their, festivities, The, grace, andbeauty, of, Mrs, S, ——, t, made, great, impression, upon, us, To, me, she, waspeculiarly, interesting, from, the, fact, of, her, being, descended, from, thenative, lords, of, the, forest, for, you, know, I, have, always, taken, thegreatest, interest, in, the, fate, of, our, Indian, tribes, From, the, accent, thedeep, brunette, of, her, smooth, skin, and, her, dark, hair, and, eyes, I, shouldhave, taken, her, for, a, Spanish, lady, From, the, tent, we, wound, our, way, up, toa, high, peak, of, the, island, When, near, the, summit, we, left, a, grove, andsaw, before, us, one, of, the, most, picturesque, and, singular, objectsimaginable, It, was, a, high, arched, rock, of, white, limestone, stretchingacross, a, chasm, before, us, making, a, pretty, natural, bridge, through, whichwe, gazed, far, down, into, the, waves, of, Huron, at, least, two, hundred, feetbelow, The, surprise, the, beauty, and, novelty, of, this, striking, objectbrought, forth, expressions, of, admiration, from, us, The, white, arch, wasadorned, with, tufts, of, wild, flowers, and, shrubbery, Ascending, the, archwe, gazed, down, upon, the, white, beach, below, whose, pebbles, could, be, heredistinctly, seen, under, the, limpid, water, although, many, feet, deep, —, and, outupon, the, fair, waters, and, the, pretty, islands, which, We, were, obliged, to, be, satisfied, with, a, hasty, view, of, this, charmingscene, as, our, time, was, limited, and, we, turned, reluctantly, towards, ourboat, without, visiting, the, ruins, of, fort, Holmes, upon, the, high, summit, ofthe, island, While, passing, through, the, town, we, observed, several, antiquehouses, which, had, been, erected, by, the, French, who, first, settled, thisplace, in, sixteen, hundred, and, seventy, three, These, are, frail, delapidated, buildings, covered, with, roofs, of, bark, Uponthe, beach, a, party, of, Indians, had, just, landed, and, we, stood, while, theytook, down, their, blanket, sail, and, hauled, their, birch, bark, canoe, abouttwenty, feet, long, upon, the, shore, These, are, the, Menominies, or, wild, riceeaters, the, ugliest, Indians, I, had, ever, seen, —, also, Winebagoes, with, darkskin, low, foreheads, and, shaggy, hair, and, having, no, pretentions, to, dressI, saw, a, chief, however, afterwards, who, was, gaily, bedizened, with, tinselbeads, and, paint, having, one, side, of, his, face, a, light, pea, green, and, theother, cheek, scarlet, We, watched, them, erect, their, lodges, which, was, donevery, soon, —, a, few, poles, were, placed, in, a, circle, one, end, of, each, stood, inthe, earth, while, the, others, met, at, the, top, —, coarse, matting, was, foldedaround, these, leaving, an, opening, for, a, door, over, which, a, blanket, washung, Some, matting, being, spread, upon, the, floor, inside, the, children, andmoveables, were, placed, inside, and, the, canoe, drawn, up, near, it, We, visitedsome, of, the, shops, and, laid, up, a, store, of, Indian, articles, which, are, madeby, these, poor, people, and, sold, here, Among, them, were, small, baskets, calledMococks, made, of, birch, bark, embroidered, with, porcupine, quills, staineddifferent, colors, —, this, was, filled, with, maple, sugar, It, is, pleasant, tomeet, friends111, so, far, from, home, but, I, think, the, pleasure, is, almostcounterbalanced, by, the, pain, of, parting, This, we, felt, keenly, when, theplanks, had, withdrawn, and, our, friends, had, been, forced, to, leave, us, as, wegazed, after, them, winding, their, way, up, to, the, fort, the, shores, andwaters, around, seemed, more, desolate, more, lonely, than, before, Just, before, the, steamboat, started, we, had, an, opportunity, of, judging, ofthe, boasted, transparency, of, this, water, its, depth, having, prevented, thison, our, voyage, I, looked, down, into, it, from, the, boat, where, it, was, twentyfeet, deep, and, could, scarcely, believe, there, was, anything, but, air, betweenus, and, those, shining, pebbles, below, We, had, also, an, opportunity, ofhearing, some, Indian, music, Upon, the, shore, sat, a, group, of, unearthlybeings, one, of, whom, struck, several, taps, upon, a, sort, of, drum, accompaniedby, the, others, in, what, sounded, like, a, wolf, recitative, —, at, the, end, ofthis, all, united, in, a, yell, which, dyed, away, over, the, lake, much, in, thestyle, of, a, howling, blast, accompanied, by, the, shrieks, of, a, drowningtraveller, Our, fishing, party, left, us, here, to, go, up, the, Sault, St, Maryinto, lake, Superior, spending, their, summer, days, among, the, picturesquescenery, of, that, magnificent, lake, We, bade, adieu, with, much, regret, to, thispretty, island, whose, green, terraces, fort, and, picturesque, town, Indianlodges, and, light, canoes, made, a, beautiful, scene, —, but, the, mostinteresting, point, in, the, view, was, that, white, handkerchief, wavingfarewell, from, the, fortress, balcony, This, island, is, 615, miles, from, Buffalo, 319, from, Detroit, There, are, watermarks, upon, the, rocks, 200, feet, above, the, lake, proving, the, water, hadonce112, stood, so, high, The, scenery, here, has, been, prettily, described, by, anauthor, of, talent, Mrs, Jameson, but, as, much, pleased, as, I, was, with, herbook, I, must, regret, she, came, here, under, such, circumstances, It, is, withreluctance, I, censure,

pile, of, ruins, were, pointed, out, as, the, site, of, old, fortMackinac, which, was, taken, by, Pontiac, with, a, stratagem, and, afterwardsevery, one, within, were, massacred, How, must, those, unfortunates, have, feltupon, this, desolate, shore, hundreds, of, miles, away, from, their, country, andat, the, mercy, of, savages, A, band, of, Chippewa, ’s, or, Ojibwa, ’s, were, justpassing, in, canoes, thirty, feet, in, length, This, tribe, stands, higher, inrank, than, the, others113, and, their, language, like, the, French, is, thepolite, tongue, among, the, Indian, tribes, They, have, a, ruler, whose, officehas, been, hereditary, for, ages, He, is, called, Mudjikiwis, and, they, pridethemselves, much, upon, his, and, their, own, rank, and, lineage, There, is, ananecdote, related, by, Schoolcraft, of, one, of, this, tribe, which, if, youhave, never, seen, will, amuse, you, Chi, Waishki, alias, the, Buffalo, waspresented, by, the, commissioners, of, the, treaty, of, Fond, du, Lac, with, amedal, as, a, badge, of, distinction, ‘, What, need, have, I, of, this, ’, he, saidhaughtily, ‘, It, is, known, whence, I, am, descended, ’, These, canoes, are, theprettiest, and, lightest, things, imaginable, They, are, formed, of, the, bark, ofthe, birch, tree, sewn, together, with, a, thread, made, from, fine, roots, ofcedar, split, The, bark, is, soaked, to, make, it, more, pliable, Sometimes, theyare, very, gaily, painted, and, ornamented, The, paddles, are, of, light, woodOur, Captain, placed, before, us, at, dinner, a, very, fine, lake, trout, which, hehad, purchased, at, Mackinaw, It, was, two, feet, long, and, very, deliciousFine, salmon, are, also, taken, in, these, lakes, We, were, now, upon, the, greatlake, Michigan, which, stretches, from, here, three, hundred, and, twenty, milesto, the, Illinois, shore, and, is, nine, hundred, feet, deep, Our, course, laynear, the, Michigan, shore, which, presented, high, bluffs, and, points, oflimestone, with, banks, of, pebbles, and, high, jagged, hills, or, dunes, ofsand, These, pebbles, and, sand, are, said, to, be, thrown, up, by, thenorthwestern, winds, but, I, should, rather, imagine, them, left, up, by, thefloods, which, have, swept, over, the, land, Upon, our, right, were, Fox, andBeaver, isles, beyond, which, Green, bay, runs, into, Wisconsin, one, hundredand, three, miles, This, northern, shore, of, Michi114gan, is, uninhabited, andcovered, with, dense, forests, The, ledges, and, masses, of, white, limestoneupon, some, of, these, islands, looked, like, fortresses, or, other, buildings, July, 5th, —, Sunday, upon, the, lake, When, I, left, my, cabin, I, found, themorning, was, misty, and, the, sun, looking, like, the, yolk, of, an, egg, wasbobbing, up, and, down, upon, the, water, It, had, just, peeped, above, the, waveswhich, dashing, about, sometimes, obscured, it, from, our, view, We, were, lyingat, one, of, the, Manitou, islands, taking, in, wood, This, is, a, pretty, crescentshape, islet, covered, with, trees, In, the, centre, we, were, told, is, a, lakewhich, is, unfathomable, and, supposed, to, be, connected, with, lake, MichiganIt, is, filled, with, the, large, trout, salmon, and, white, fish, of, the, lakesThere, is, a, woodman, ’s, hut, and, several, large, piles, of, wood, upon, theshore, ‘, Oh, that, the, woodman, would, spare, those, trees, ’, Soon, the, prettyisland, will, be, denuded, and, forlorn, It, is, a, sacred, island, —, the, Indiansimagining, it, to, be, the, residence, of, their, Manitou, never, dare, to, landthere, as, they, believe, such, an, intrusion, would, be, followed, by, the, angerof, their, Deity, One, Indian, who, despised, such, superstition, ventured, uponthe, shore, and, was, never, heard, of, since, The, forests, and, lake, in, theinterior, they, imagine, is, the, abode, of, the, blessed, after, death, whosehours, will, there, pass, in, hunting, and, fishing, The, Manitoulin, islands, inlake, Huron, are, also, sacred, but, they, are, much, larger, than, these, one, ofthem, being, fiftyfive, miles, in, length, I, secured, a, handful, of, pebblesfrom, the, shore, which, like, those, of, other, lakes, are, agate, chalcedonyand, other, sileceous, minerals, Upon, the115, shores, of, lake, Superior, theseare, found, very, fine, mixed, with, trachte, lava, and, other, volcanic, rocksand, with, masses, of, native, copper, I, had, brought, with, me, a, package, ofwell, selected, tracks, which, I, opened, this, morning, and, laid, a, few, uponthe, table, of, the, ladies, saloon, Soon, after, a, pretty, little, girl, knockedat, my, stateroom, door, saying, her, mother, wished, to, know, if, I, had, anymore, tracts, as, she, should, like, to, read, one, I, asked, her, where, werethose, I, laid, upon, the, table, those, she, replied, some, ladies, werereading, I, gave, her, several, The, chambermaid, next, appeared, begging, forsome, and, then, the, cabin, boy, came, with, the, same, request, While, I, wasselecting, one, which, I, thought, might, suit, him, I, observed, a, brawny, duskyfigure, with, his, shirt, sleeves, rolled, up, and, his, person, begrimed, withsoot, and, smoke, gazing, earnestly, towards, us, ‘, That, ’s, Tom, one, of, thefiremen, ’, said, the, cabin, boy, with, a, snigger, ‘, he, heard, you, had, books, tolend, and, wants, one, dreadfully, ’, I, beckoned, to, him, and, he, came, forwardwith, alacrity, while, behind, him, I, discerned, several, other, ‘, grim, visaged’beings, peeping, out, from, their, compartment, towards, us, I, gave, him, apackage, to, distribute, among, his, fellows, and, during, the, day, had, thepleasure, of, observing, the, greater, part, of, the, crew, and, passengers, busilyengaged, with, my, books, During, our, long, voyage, those, who, had, books, hadread, them, out, and, those, who, had, none, were, getting, very, weary, so, thatthey, eagerly, received, any, thing, in, the, shape, of, reading, But, some, ofthem, I, trust, read, them, for, the, sake, of, the, benefit, they, hoped, toreceive, from, their, contents, It, was, a, source, of, great, satisfaction, tobehold, so, many, persons, engaged, in, themes, of, high, im116port, to, their, soul’sbest, interest, These, seeds, were, sown, with, a, prayer, for, their, successand, who, can, tell, what, immortal, plants, may, spring, up, in, some, of, theirhearts, growing, to, a, tree, of, life, and, bearing, fruit, to, flourish, in, thegarden, of, paradise, Let, me, urge, you, never, to, travel, without, these, orother, useful, books, to, distribute, on, your, way, —, like, the, girl, in, the, fairytale, of, our, youth, shedding, gems, and, treasures, in, your, path, There, is, nolibrary, in, this, boat, as, upon, our, Hudson, and, Eastern, steamboats, and, wewere, often, amused, with, the, alacrity, with, which, our, books, were, snatchedup, when, we, laid, them, down, for, a, strole, or, to, look, at, some, object, uponthe, shores, When, we, returned, we, were, always, sure, to, receive, them, againand, felt, no, vexation, as, we, knew, they, meant, no, impoliteness, and, wouldbe, willing, to, lend, us, their, own, in, return, My, companion, had, never, beenused, to, such, socialisms, in, his, country, and, was, quite, amused, at, thisfree, and, easy, sort, of, thing, Our, books, were, some, of, them, French, andupon, one, occasion, we, found, them, in, the, hands, of, a, simple, hearted, son, ofthe, forest, to, whom, books, were, so, rare, a, treasure, he, could, not, resistexamining, them, He, returned, it, with, a, smile, and, said, shaking, his, head‘how, you, can, make, any, sense, out, of, that, I, ca, n’t, see, for, I, can, not, read, aword, of, it, ’, We, lost, sight, of, the, Michigan, shore, at, ten, o’clock, and, stretched, acrossthe, lake, towards, the, Wisconsin, coast, which, we, first, saw, at, four, o’clockP, M, thus, being, nearly, all, day, out, of, the, sight, of, land, This, may, giveyou, an, idea, of, the, vastness, of, these, lakes, Wisconsin, or, Ouisconsin, orWiskonsan, here, presents, a, high, bank, called, ‘, red, banks, ’, from, thecolor117, of, the, soil, covered, with, forests, and, showing, no, trace, of, manexcept, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, Sheboygan, two, hundred, and, twenty, milesfrom, Mackinaw, where, is, a, small, settlement, called, by, the, name, of, theriver, Fifty, miles, from, Sheboygan, we, stopped, at, the, town, of, Milwaukie, towardswhich, the, tide, of, emigration, has, been, rapidly, flowing, As, the, bay, iscrossed, by, a, bar, our, large, boat, could, not, enter, and, a, small, steamboattook, from, us, much, of, our, merchandise, and, most, of, our, emigrants, We, didnot, go, on, shore, but, contented, ourselves, with, seeing, the, town, from, theboat, It, looked, neat, with, some, comfortable, dwellings, several, shopshotel, court, house, c, It, stands, upon, the, Milwaukie, river, Itspopulation, is, 1000, Several, railroads, and, canals, are, in, contemplationfrom, this, place, across, the, territory, as, railroads, to, Winnebago, lakefrom, Belmont, to, Dubuque, from, Belmont, to, Dodgeville, in, the, minedistrict, a, canal, from, Milwaukie, to, the, Black, river, and, another, throughthe, Fox, and, Wisconsin, to, the, Mississippi, Wisconsin, will, be, soon, coveredwith, a, dense, population, as, it, is, now, a, favorite, point, for, emigrationThe, soil, is, very, rich, from, one, to, ten, feet, deep, the, surface, undulatingprairie, and, woodland, consisting, of, 100000, square, miles, of, fertileland, The, grassy, plains, make, fine, pasture, lands, and, the, lakes, andrivers, produce, abundance, of, fish, and, give, great, manufacturing, powerLakes, Superior, and, Michigan, and, the, river, Mississippi, surround, threesides, thus, enabling, them, to, send, their, produce, to, market, Flour, ryecorn, barley, whitefish, and, many, other, articles, have, been, exportedthis, year, Their, lead, mines, are, very, rich, and, their, valuable, forests, ofpine, trees, will, be, another, source, of118, wealth, These, growing, to, theheight, of, one, hundred, and, eighty, or, two, hundred, feet, crown, the, heightsof, the, northern, region, of, the, country, which, is, mountainous, containingseveral, waterfalls, one, of, which, is, two, hundred, and, fifty, feet, inheight, The, scenery, is, very, picturesque, Madison, the, capital, is, apretty, thriving, town, surrounded, by, four, transparent, lakes, upon, theshore, of, one, of, which, it, is, situated, it, sometimes, goes, by, the, poeticalappellation, of, ‘, city, of, the, four, lakes, ’, When, the, roads, and, canals, areformed, Wisconsin, will, soon, become, a, thoroughfare, to, the, Mississippi, andthe, vast, regions, beyond, and, those, who, have, ‘, the, world, before, them’cannot, make, a, better, choice, than, this, Here, we, left, our, Buffalo, huntersRacine, is, a, town, twentytwo, miles, below, Milwaukie, The, houses, lookednew, and, were, arranged, in, rows, upon, the, high, green, bank, The, courthousewas, quite, showy, having, a, portico, in, front, with, pillars, reaching, to, theroof, which, was, painted, red, surmounted, by, a, tin, cupola, It, stands, atthe, mouth, of, Root, river, We, were, now, again, in, sight, of, Michigan, as, thelake, grows, narrower, towards, the, end, We, have, passed, completely, aroundthis, state, it, being, in, the, shape, of, a, triangle, It, is, destined, to, be, agreat, and, flourishing, State, surrounded, as, it, is, by, the, lakes, crossedby, rivers, canals, and, railroads, and, covered, by, a, rich, soil, It, is, twohundred, and, eighty, miles, long, by, one, hundred, and, eighty, and, covers40000, square, miles, It, has, only, been, admitted, into, the, Union, as, a, Statein, 1837, and, now, possesses, a, population, of, 211705, The, country, islevel, except, a, table, land, in, the, center, from, which, the, rivers, flow, intolakes, St, Clair, Huron, and, Michigan, The, remainder, is, covered, withgrassy119, prairie, land, with, transparent, lakes, and, tracts, of, woodlandHere, grows, the, valuable, maple, from, which, they, obtain,

conveyingtheir, produce, to, its, market, One, hundred, and, thirtyone, miles, ofrailroad, has, been, contracted, for, but, only, fortyfour, miles, finishedfrom, Detroit, to, Ann, Arbor, Over, this, 41896, barrels, of, flour, wereconveyed, this, year, to, Detroit, Three, years, since, the, inhabitants, of, thisstate, sent, to, Ohio, for, their, flour, and, now, they, export, 125000, barrelsof, flour, this, year, Education, is, not, neglected, the, legislature, haveappropriated, 1200000, acres, of, land, as, a, school, fund, which, as, theland, is, rapidly, rising, will, be, of, great, value, The, celebratedSchoolcraft, tells, us, it, was, deemed, so, inaccessible, from, swamps, that, in1818, it, was, not, thought, fit, for, the, soldiers, bounty, lands, This, washowever, soon, discovered, to, be, a, mistake, He, further, informs, us, thesoil, is, an, argillaceous, soil, mellowed, with, sands, and, pebbles, underlaidwith, schistose, and, calcareous, rocks, clothed, with, an,

lookback, with, regret, at, the, beautiful, lake, I, was, leaving, for, I, was, wellassured, ‘, I, ne’er, should, look, upon, its, like, again, ’, Two, days, and, twonights, I, had, been, sailing, over, it, never, tired, of, gazing, at, its, variedshores, or, beauteous, waters, Those, who, have, never, beheld, these, masses, ofpellucid, brilliant, green, waters, can, never, imagine, the, extraordinaryloveliness, of, the, scene, They, cover, a, surface, of, 150000, square, milesand, contain, nearly, half, the, fresh, water, upon, the, surface, of, the, globeThat, the, water, is, fresh, is, of, great, importance, to, those, who, dwell, upontheir, shores, as, it, can, be, of, more, use, for, household, purposes, andmachinery, The, valley, in, which, the, lakes, repose, is, said, to, have, beenhewed, out, by, the, deluge, leaving, the, deep, chasms, in, which, the, waterslie, this, is, called, the, valley, of, the, St, Lawrence, and, very, properlybut, I, must, object, to, this, immense, chain, of, lakes, four, and, five, hundredmiles, long, and, nine, hundred, deep, being, called, the, ‘, river, StLawrence, ’, as, some, fashionable, tourists, have, of, late, The, St, Lawrenceriver, is, an, outlet, but, is, no, more, entitled, to, this, designation, than, isNiagara, or, St, Clair, river, These, lakes, all, lie, in, a, valley, whichinterposes, between, the, primitive, and, secondary, formations, The, northernshores, are, granite, rocks, sterile, and, scarcely, inhabited, while, thesouthern, is, rich, alluvion, covering, sandstone, and, limestone, The, bustle, of, arrival, aroused, me, from, these, reflections, and, we, weresoon, seated, in, the, parlor, of, the, Lake, Hotel, in, the, famous, state, ofIllinois, and, town, of, Chicago, The, rapid, growth, of, this, place, you, haveheard, of, in, 1833, it, could, only, count, three, frame121, dwellings, and, twohundred, and, fifty, inhabitants, and, now, enumerates, six, churches, onehundred, shops, several, hotels, dwelling, houses, and, warehouses, andbetween, six, and, seven, thousand, inhabitants, Chicago, or, Tshicawgo, asthe, inhabitants, and, Indians, call, it, is, divided, by, a, river, of, the, samename, into, two, parts, between, which, is, a, free, ferry, and, a, bridge, Theshops, are, upon, one, side, and, the, dwellings, upon, the, other, These, lastare, in, the, style, of, country, residences, enclosed, with, white, palingssurrounded, by, piazzas, and, gardens, some, of, brick, but, many, of, wood, andneatly, painted, Every, thing, looks, quite, new, as, indeed, it, might, forwhere, now, the, town, stands, was, as, late, as, 1833, a, fort, before, whichwas, encamped, seven, thousand, Indians, Fort, Dearborn, was, erected, for, thepurpose, of, protecting, the, frontier, It, was, attacked, in, 1812, by, theIndian, tribes, and, their, allies, and, those, who, escaped, massacre, soughtprotection, in, fort, Wayne, Another, fort, was, built, in, 1818, but, is, nowdeserted, and, let, out, for, tenements, There, are, houses, of, worship, here, forseveral, denominations, among, them, the, Presbyterian, church, is, mostconspicuous, It, is, of, brick, and, neatly, finished, Part, of, the, moneyrequired, for, its, erection, was, acquired, by, the, ladies, in, a, Fair, TheLake, House, is, a, very, good, hotel, situated, among, the, dwelling, houses, Itis, built, of, brick, painted, white, which, with, its, green, blinds, gives, ita, pleasant, appearance, every, thing, within, was, comfortable, and, good, ofits, kind, According, to, our, usual, practice, we, ascended, to, the, cupola, ofthe, hotel, where, is, a, lovely, view, of, the, cottages, and, gardens, at, ourfeet, the, broad, prairies, beyond, and, the, bright, waters, of, Michiganbehind, us, This, town122, is, beautifully, situated, upon, the, borders, of, thelake, through, which, it, holds, constant, communication, with, Buffalo, and, theeast, The, other, route, I, mentioned, from, Detroit, continues, over, therailroad, at, that, city, and, by, cross, roads, to, St, Joseph, ’s, upon, thelake, from, which, place, steamboats, are, continually, plying, to, Chicago, Itis, a, shorter, road, and, gives, the, traveller, a, view, of, the, interior, ofMichigan, The, Illinois, and, Michigan, canal, commences, here, which, is, to, becarried, to, Peru, on, the, Illinois, river, a, distance, of, one, hundred, milesthus, opening, a, communication, with, the, Mississippi, and, the, Gulf, ofMexico, It, is, six, feet, deep, and, sixty, feet, wide, and, is, nearly, finishedThe, climate, here, is, variable, In, the, summer, the, wind, will, one, day, blowover, the, surface, of, the, prairies, and, the, weather, will, become, very, hotbut, the, next, day, perhaps, it, will, come, from, the, lake, and, cool, it, againIn, consequence, of, the, vicinity, of, the, lake, there, is, not, much, snow, andit, is, not, very, cold, We, spent, here, one, day, only, but, were, able, to, see, every, thing, in, andabout, the, town, and, in, conversation, with, those, friends, residing, hereobtained, every, information, We, intended, making, a, longer, stay, butlearned, that, the, regular, line, of, stages, left, town, that, evening, whichobliged, us, to, go, on, or, to, stay, longer, than, our, time, would, admit, Beforereaching, here, it, was, our, intention, to, go, to, Michigan, City, which, is, inIndiana, upon, the, shores, of, the, lake, and, from, thence, cross, Indiana, toMadison, upon, the, Ohio, through, a, fine, succession, of, rail, andMacadamized, roads, Our, friends, here, however, seemed, to, think, it, somonstrous, a, thing, to, return, without, beholding, the, celebratedMississippi, when, within, a, few, hundred, miles123, only, that, we, determinedto, alter, our, course, and, go, down, the, Illinois, river, At, nine, o’clock, at, night, we, entered, a, commodious, stage, drawn, by, fourgood, horses, which, was, to, take, us, to, Peoria, upon, the, Illinois, onehundred, and, fiftyseven, miles, distant, for, which, we, were, to, paytwentytwo, dollars, eleven, each, bed, and, board, included, Beside, us, weretwo, other, passengers, Crossing, the, bridge, we, took, up, the, mail, at, thepost, office, and, then, drove, through, a, long, range, of, cheerfully, lightedshops, until, we, found, ourselves, out, of, town, Here, the, road, crossed, thewet, prairie, as, it, is, called, which, in, some, seasons, when, the, lake, ishigh, is, overflown, Through, this, wet, land, we, went, splash, splash, nearlyhalf, the, night, A, railroad, is, proposed, here, which, will, rendertravelling, more, pleasant, Hour, after, hour, passed, away, my, companions, alldozing, while, I, sought, sleep, in, vain, The, vast, plain, over, which, we, weremoving, seen, through, the, dusk, of, a, cloudy, night, seemed, a, fitting, placefor, dark, deeds, —, a, fine, Hounslow, heath, or, Indian, lurking, place, Butthere, are, no, bandits, here, and, the, Indians, were, all, over, theMississippi, and, I, was, bidding, such, idle, fears, avaunt, when, suddenly, alow, plaintive, wail, sounded, over, the, waste, startling, my, companions, fromtheir, slumbers, ‘, What, was, that, unearthly, cry, ’, I, asked, ‘, Only, a, prairiewolf, madam, ’, ‘, Dear, me, ’, exclaimed, the, other, passenger, a, youth, ‘, I, hopethere, are, not, many, of, them, for, sometimes, wolves, attack, horses, ’, ‘, Not, inthese, prairies, sir, ’, replied, the, other, passenger, ‘, they, are, rather, shyand, afraid, of, us, ’, ‘, I, am, glad, at, least, to, see, a, light, ’, returned, theyouth, ‘, there, must, be, a, house, yonder, ’, ‘, Yes, a, bower, in, the, rushesnothing, else, ’, replied, the124, other, man, ‘, If, you, follow, that, light, it, willlead, you, a, pretty, chase, through, the, marshes, it, is, a, jacko’lantern’The, hour, seen, by, the, light, of, the, coach, lamp, proved, to, be, twelve, andeach, settled, in, his, corner, for, another, doze, A, sudden, halt, of, the, stageawakened, us, The, coachman, took, down, a, lamp, and, began, to, search, forsomething, on, the, ground, ‘, Halo, driver, what, have, you, lost, ’, asked, theyouth, ‘, Only, my, road, sir, ’, he, replied, ‘, Lost, your, road, ’, exclaimed, theyouth, in, dismay, ‘, Lost, in, these, lonely, moors, among, wolverines, andjacko’lanterns, Here, ’s, a, pretty, fix, ’, ‘, Driver, you, ought, to, keep, theskin, off, your, eyes, in, such, a, dark, night, I, guess, ’, said, the, otherpassenger, I, only, wondered, he, could, ever, keep, his, road, as, there, was, nohouse, or, tree, to, mark, his, course, even, in, the, day, and, one, might, easilypass, over, the, worn, pathway, in, these, grassy, plains, The, driver, soonresumed, his, seat, having, discovered, his, path, and, gave, us, the, agreeableintelligence, he, had, gone, three, miles, out, of, his, way, A, few, hours, afterthis, a, huge, body, suddenly, appeared, before, the, window, —, it, turned, out, tobe, a, tree, a, sign, we, were, approaching, a, river, Soon, after, we, foundourselves, before, the, door, of, a, small, house, upon, the, banks, of, a, narrowbut, deep, and, placid, stream, fringed, with, trees, This, was, the, Des, Plainesa, river, which, rises, so, near, lake, Michigan, that, in, times, of, itsoverflow, boats, have, passed, from, one, to, another, This, interlocking, ofwaters, which, flow, different, ways, Darby, considers, ‘, an, astonishinghydrographical, anomaly, ’, All, the, waters, we, had, passed, have, fallen, intothe, Atlantic, while, those, we, were, now, following, find, their, way, into, thegulf, of, Mexico, The, Des, Plaines, is, called, a, branch, of, the125, Illinoiswhich, joins, with, the, Kankakee, and, afterwards, the, Fox, and, the, unitedstreams, take, the, name, of, the, Illinois, Many, modern, writers, consider, thisas, the, Illinois, and, drop, the, name, of, Des, Plaines, which, I, should, judgea, proper, arrangement, We, awakened, the, drowsy, owner, of, the, houseprocured, some, refreshment, and, with, fresh, horses, resumed, our, journey, July, 7th, —, I, fell, asleep, and, when, I, was, awakened, at, dawn, thismorning, by, my, companion, that, I, might, not, lose, the, scene, I, startedwith, surprise, and, delight, I, was, in, the, midst, of, a, prairie, A, world, ofgrass, and, flowers, stretched, around, me, rising, and, falling, in, gentleundulations, as, if, an, enchanter, had, struck, the, ocean, swell, and, it, wasat, rest, forever, Acres, of, wild, flowers, of, every, hue, glowed, around, meand, the, sun, arising, from, the, earth, where, it, touched, the, horizon, was‘kissing, with, golden, face, the, meadows, green, ’, What, a, new, and, wonderousworld, of, beauty, What, a, magnificent, sight, Those, glorious, ranks, offlowers, Oh, that, you, could, have, ‘, one, glance, at, their, array, ’, How, shall, Iconvey, to, you, an, idea, of, a, prairie, I, despair, for, never, yet, hath, penbrought, the, scene, before, my, mind, Imagine, yourself, in, the, centre, of, animmense, circle, of, velvet, herbage, the, sky, for, its, boundary, upon, everyside, the, whole, clothed, with, a, radiant, efflorescence, of, every, brillianthue, We, rode, thus, through, a, perfect, wilderness, of, sweets, sending, forthperfume, and, animated, with, myriads, of, glittering, birds, andbutterflies, —, It, was, in, fact, a, vast, garden, over, whose, perfumed, paths, covered, withsoil, as, hard, as, gravel, our, carriage, rolled, through, the, whole, of, thatsummer, day, You, will, scarcely, credit, the, profusion, of, flowers, upon, theseprairies, We, passed, whole, acres, of, blossoms, all, bearing, one, hue, aspurple, perhaps, or, masses, of, yellow, or, rose, and, then, again, a, carpet, ofevery, color, intermixed, or, narrow, bands, as, if, a, rainbow, had, fallen, uponthe, verdant, slopes, When, the, sun, flooded, this, Mosaic, floor, with, lightand, the, summer, breeze, stirred, among, their, leaves, the, irredescent, glowwas, beautiful, and, wonderous, beyond, any, thing, I, had, ever, conceived, Ithink, this, must, have, been,

variety, to, its, lights, and, shades, Occasionally, when, a, swell, israther, higher, than, the, rest, it, gives, you, an, extended, view, over, thecountry, and, you, may, mark, a, dark, green, waving, line, of, trees, near, thedistant, horizon, which, are, shading, some, gentle, stream, from, the, sun’sabsorbing, rays, and, thus, ‘, Betraying, the, secret, of, their, silent, course’Oak, openings, also, occur, green, groves, arranged, with, the, regularity, ofart, making, shady, alleys, for, the, heated, traveller, What, a, tenderbenevolent, Father, have, we, to, form, for, us, so, bright, a, world, How, filledwith, glory, and, beauty, must, that, mind, have, been, who, conceived, so, muchloveliness, If, for, his, erring, children, he, has, created, so, fair, a, dwellingplace,

into, our, hearts, to, conceive, it, I, observe, in, all, fashionable, tours, what, is, eaten, and, drank, seems, to, bematter, of, immense, importance, and, perhaps, you, will, be, disappointed, if, Ido, not, touch, upon, themes, of, such, high, import, We, had, been, warned, ourfare, upon, these, ‘, lonesome, prairies, ’, would, be, poor, and, of, course, we, didnot, expect, the, tables, of, a, New, York, hotel, The, scarcity, of, stone, and, ofwood, —, as, there, are, no, pine, and, cedar, except, in, the, northern, parts, ofWisconsin, —, forbids, much, elegance, in, the, few, houses, scattered, along, theroad, and, the, first, post, house, at, which, we, stopped, for, breakfast, was, arude, log, cabin, Our, detention, during, the, night, had, prevented, ourarriving, at, the, usual, breakfast, hour, and, it, was, supposed, we, had, takenour, meal, elsewhere, and, of, course, we, were, obliged, to, wait, ‘, BreakfastBreakfast, ’, was, the, cry, of, driver, and, passengers, as, we, alighted, ‘, Ayeaye, ’, returned, the, landlord—‘I, will, scare, you, up, as, good, a, feed, as, youcould, find, in, Chicago, ’, The, room, we, entered, was, plainly, furnished, but, Iremarked, a, pile, of, books, upon, a, bureau, among, which, were, the, life, ofGen, Harrison, —, Rollins, Ancient, History, —, Vicar, of, Wakefield, and, severalreligious, works, I, regretted, I,

others, followed, it, and, soon, beautiful, groups, of, forest, treeswere, sprinkled, over, the, prairie, in, front, This, was, a, token, of, thevicinity, of, water, and, in, a, short, time, we, found, ourselves, upon, anelevated, bank, from, which, we, looked, down, upon, a, verdant, valley, throughthe, centre, of, which, ran, a, silver, stream, This, was, the, valley, of, the, DesPlaines, —, having, every, appearance, of, being, the, bed, of, a, broad, and, deepriver, Many, geologists, among, them, Prof, Sheppard, thinks, this, and, thevalley, of, the, Illinois, have, been, scooped, out, by, a, vast, torrent, pouringfrom, lake, Michigan, Upon, the, opposite, shore, of, the, river, and, in, thisvale, at, the, foot, of, the, ancient, bank, stands, the, pretty, town, of, Jolietimproperly, spelt, Juliet, The, whole, scene, was, one, of, great, beauty, Wedescended, the, bank, which, is, nearly, one, hundred, feet, high, and, iscomposed, of, yellow, waterworn, pebbles, Winding, down, the, road, upon, thehigh, bank, opposite, was, a, long, train, of, covered, waggons, filled, with, ahousehold, upon, its, way, to130, ‘, a, new, home, ’, upon, the, prairies, After, fordingthe, stream, now, rendered, shallow, by, the, summer, heats, passing, over, thegreen, sward, we, found, ourselves, before, the, door, of, the, principal, hotel, inthe, town, Joliet, takes, its, name, from, the, old, French, traveller, fatherJoliet, who, came, here, as, a, missionary, in, 1673, and, stands, at, the, mouthof, a, little, stream, of, the, same, name, This, is, growing, into, a, place, ofsome, importance, as, the, Michigan, canal, crosses, the, river, here, and, alltravellers, to, the, Illinois, pass, through, it, It, has, a, fine, water, powerfor, the, descent, of, this, river, to, the, rapids, at, Ottowa, is, great, —, thelockage, of, the, canal, being, 142, feet, The, population, is, over, 600, Thereis, here, a, court, house, houses, of, worship, mills, taverns, and, severalshops, We, remained, here, only, long, enough, to, change, horses, Whilestanding, upon, the, steps, the, covered, waggons, arrived, from, which, lookedforth, men, women, children, dogs, and, cats, while, pots, and, kettles, andchairs, were, dangling, below, A, group, of, sturdy, looking, men, stood, aroundthe, door, After, our, American, fashion, of, asking, questions, I, addressedone, of, them, who, stood, near, me, and, asked, from, what, country, he, hadtravelled, ‘, From, St, Thomas, in, Canada, ma’am, ’, he, replied, ‘, We, are, sixtyfamilies, ’, said, another, ‘, and, have, left, there, because, we, want, morefreedom, We, would, live, where, we, can, say, what, we, choose, and, do, what, wechoose, There, our, tongues, are, fettered, ’, I, learnt, they, were, going, toRock, river, a, very, fashionable, place, of, emigration, now, This, is, abeautiful, stream, running, through, the, north, west, part, of, Illinois, intothe, Mississippi, The, land, is, prairie, upon, its, borders, which, will, wellrepay, the, agriculturist, ’s, labors, while131, its, rapids, place, a, great, amountof, manufacturing, power, at, the, disposal, of, the, settlers, The,

garrisoned, by, United, States, troops, Dixonville, on, thisriver, is, a, growing, town, This, I, learned, from, my, emigrants, andafterwards, saw, confirmed, in, a, Gazetteer, So, you, see, what, a, nice, plan, itis, while, travelling, to, extract, information, from, all, you, meet, I, am, neverbashful, at, asking, I, bade, adieu, to, the, emigrants, hoping, they, would, havetheir, full, of, chat, from, which, it, seems, they, were, debarred, and, let, theprairies, ‘, prate, of, their, whereabouts, ’, We, recrossed, the, river, where, wefound, the, newer, part, of, Joliet, built, in, a, solid, manner, of, the, yellowlimestone, which, is, quarried, here, The, sides, of, the, canal, and, viaductwere, also, formed, of, this, pretty, stone, which, gives, quite, a, gay, look, tothe, place, It, is, said, by, Professor, Shephard, to, be, magnesian, limestonewhich, occurs, also, at, Chicago, abounding, in, orthrocera, turboterebratula, caryophillia, c, and, extends, he, thinks, through, the, lakesIt, is, taken, out, here, in, stratified, layers, and, at, Chicago, where, it, hasa, slaty, structure, it, is, used, for, flagging, A, few, miles, from, Joliet, wepassed, an, object, to, me, of, the, greatest, interest, —, it, was, an, Indianmound, This, was, a, perfect, gem, —, as, regular, as, smooth, and, as, green, as, ifcut, out, of, an, emerald, —, being, an, oblong, of, fifty, rods, high, and, seventyor, eighty, long, Although, centuries, have, passed, since, it, was, formed, itis, as, perfect, in, shape, as, if, just, moulded, A, beautiful, solitary, thingit, is, telling, of, nations, and, events, now, lost, in, the, mists, of, time, We132saw, afterwards, several, others, bearing, upon, their, summits, ancient, oaksplain, indication, of, their, great, antiquity, Flowers, again, in, untoldnumbers, were, covering, the, prairies, and, here, are, many, of, our, gardenflowers, growing, wild, as, blue, bells, flox, bouncing, bet, sweet, williamroses, cocoris, beliotrope, astre, c, beside, wild, flowers, as, fringedgentean, solidago, orchis, yellow, golden, rod, scarlet, lilly, wildindigo, superb, pink, moccasin, flower, and, scarlet, lobelia, There, weremany, I, had, never, seen, —, among, them, was, a, species, of, teazle, having, a, tallstem, purple, head, surrounded, by, a, fringe, of, long, pink, leaves, —, I, calledit, the, Indian, fairy, for, as, its, dark, head, bobbed, about, and, its, pinkmantle, flowed, around, it, it, looked, like, a, tiny, Indian, In, fact, flowers, were, smiling, and, blooming, in, every, direction, What, a, nice, place, for, somehortuculturist, to, transport, himself, and, cottage, Rural, Howett, wouldenjoy, the, scene, —, and, Miller, who, loves, to, ‘, babble, o, ’, green, fields, ’, andflowers, would, find, fitting, subject, here, for, his, blossoming, pen, I, welcome, every, flower, I, see, with, tender, pleasure, as, if, the, gift, of, afriend, —, for, I, know, they, were, planted, among, us, to, add, to, our, enjoymentTheir, culture, has, soothed, many, a, mourning, heart, and, their, blossoming, isas, eagerly, looked, for, in, the, spring, as, if, their, own, loved, one, wasreturning, from, the, earth, There, is, nothing, that, can, so, soon, transport, usto, scenes, and, friends, long, gone, and, awaken, buried, memories, of, formerjoy, as, these, brilliant, creations, Earth, would, look, dim, without, them, —, thebride, would133, want, a, grace, —, the, bier, would, seem, more, gloomy, —, while, thesculptor, the, artist, and, the, embroiderer, would, lose, their, prettiestmodel, of, adornment, A, line, of, trees, proclaimed, a, river, near, and, we, soon, dashed, through, theAu, Sable, the, horses, dancing, with, joy, as, the, clear, cool, waters, curledabout, their, feet, The, sight, of, a, house, upon, the, opposite, bank, seemedquite, a, novelty, as, we, had, not, seen, one, since, leaving, Joliet, at, nineo’clock, and, it, was, now, one, The, house, was, of, boards, painted, white, anda, hanging, sign, proclaimed, it, one, of, entertainment, Here, we, dined, andchanged, horses, The, meats, were, very, good, the, pies, and, custardstolerable, but, the, vegetables, were, the, finest, we, had, ever, tasted, Peasbeans, potatoes, all, were, very, excellent, Every, thing, we, saw, was, from, thelandlords, farm, which, extended, over, the, prairie, some, distance, from, hishouse, He, and, his, men, came, in, from, the, corn, fields, when, the, conchsounded, for, dinner, and, without, their, coats, —, their, shirt, sleeves, rolledup, they, placed, themselves, beside, us, —, one, does, not, dress, for, dinner, uponthe, prairies, While, travelling, in, unsettled, countries, one, must, leave, allone, ’s, nicities, at, home, It, took, us, some, little, time, to, shut, our, eyesagainst, soiled, table, covers, iron, knives, and, forks, c, —, but, onceresolved, to, overlook, it, we, succeeded, and, ceased, to, notice, it, When, weconsider, what, a, life, these, early, settlers, have, led, we, should, onlywonder, things, are, as, decent, as, they, are, The, man, comes, out, here, in, hisyouth, with, an, axe, upon, his, shoulder, —, hews, him, a, space, in, the, forestand, erects, a, log, hut, —, here, upon, the, floor, spread, with, the, skin, of, abeast, perhaps, he, sleeps, his, only, companions, his, dog, or, an, Indian, —, hegradually, acquires134, furniture, of, his, own, making, and, when, he, came, toeating, from, a, table, instead, of, a, stone, or, a, stump, he, thinks, himselfvery, comfortable, A, table, cloth, is, such, a, luxury, that, he, scarcelyremarks, when, it, gets, soiled, as, even, then, it, is, cleaner, than, his, logtable, and, knives, of, the, coarsest, description, are, treasures, to, him, Ourlandlord, spoke, of, his, prairie, land, with, the, greatest, enthusiasm, Theground, is, very, hard, to, break, generally, requiring, several, yoke, of, oxenwhile, beneath, that, the, mould, is, several, feet, in, thickness, withoutstones, requiring, no, manuring, and, apparently, inexhaustible, Some, of, theold, settlements, where, farms, had, been, worked, for, twelve, years, it, wasstill, as, fertile, as, ever, —, giving, the, tiller, very, little, trouble, andyielding, rich, crops, The, oasis, or, ‘, oak, openings, ’, upon, the, prairies, arevery, beautiful, We, passed, through, one, this, morning, It, presented, theappearance, of, a, lawn, or, park, around, some, gentleman, ’s, seat, The, treesare, generally, oak, arranged, in, pretty, clumps, or, clusters, upon, the, smoothgrass, —, or, in, long, avenues, as, if, planted, thus, by, man, From, their, limbshang, pretty, vines, as, the, pea, vine, —, lonicera, flava, honeysuckle, —, andwhite, convolvulus, While, our, carriage, wound, among, these, clumps, orthrough, the, avenues, it, was, almost, impossible, to, dispel, the, illusionthat, we, were, not, driving, through, the, domain, of, some, rich, proprietor, andwe, almost, expected, to, draw, up, before, the, door, of, some, lordly, mansionOur, afternoon, drive, from, the, Au, Sable, to, Ottowa, was, through, a, treelessprairie, looking, very, much, like, a, vast, lake, or, ocean, So, much, is, thisappearance, acknowledged, by, the, country, people, that, they, call, the, stagecoach, a, prairie, schooner, When135, the, sun, shines, brightly, over, thelandscape, its, yellow, light, gives, the, prairie, an, azure, hue, so, that, onecan, scarcely, see, where, the, earth, ends, and, the, sky, begins, Theundulations, are, a, very, singular, feature, in, the, landscape, This, is, bestseen, at, early, morning, or, sunset, light, —, the, summit, of, every, little, swellis, illumined, while, the, hollow, between, lies, in, shadow, thus, making, theground, a, curious, chequer, work, We, saw, many, prairie, hens, or, species, ofgrouse, this, afternoon, but, no, wolves, or, deer, much, to, my, regret, Theroad, is, so, much, travelled, that, they, avoid, it, and, retire, to, moresequestered, places, Birds, innumerable, were, sporting, in, the, sun, ’s, lightamong, the, flowers, and, butterflies, clad, like, Miltons, angels, in, ‘, purplebeams, and, azure, wings, that, up, they, fly, so, drest, ’, And, now, you, ask, to, what, is, the, prairie, land, owing, fire, or, water, Manyare, the, theories, upon, this, subject, The, Indian, name, for, prairie, isscutay, fire, and, they, are, in, the, custom, of, burning, off, the, grassevery, fall, Some, will, tell, you, to, this, must, be, traced, the, dearth, oftrees, As, the, mould, is, so, deep, —, in, some, places, twenty, feet, and, thereare, in, it, except, in, one, or, two, places, no, trace, of, trees, or, the, hugestumps, they, leave, this, does, not, seem, probable, at, least, the, trees, musthave, been, burnt, from, ages, Others, will, tell, you, it, is, the, sediment, of, anocean, which, is, spread, over, the, land, —, or, in, some, places, large, lakes, InIllinois, it, is, said, there, was, once, as, large, a, lake, as, Michigan, whichburst, its, barrier, at, the, grand, tower, rocks, upon, the, Mississippi, A, chainof, lakes, it, is, said, have, once, stood, upon, the, western, land, which, haveleft, these, basins, of, deep, alluvion, covered, with, herbage, These, watertheorists, one, of, whom, is, Schoolcraft136, point, to, the, bowlder, ’s, ofgranite, and, gneiss, which, are, scattered, over, the, country, from, thenorthern, ocean, to, the, gulf, of, Mexico, lost, rocks, as, they, are, called, astraces, of, this, flood, Why, not, join, the, two, theories, The, land, has, nodoubt, been, covered, with, water, this, is, proved, by, the, ‘, lost, rocks, ’, bythe, hard, packed, soil, like, the, bottom, of, a, lake, by, its, inky, blacknesswhen, wet, as, we, see, in, marshes, and, by, the, marsh, grasses, and, waterplants, which, are, seen, growing, upon, it, This, land, when, dry, was, occupiedby, the, Indians, who, kindled, a, fire, at, the, edges, of, a, circle, among, therushes, which, drove, the, animals, in, the, centre, where, they, were, caughtThe, roots, of, the, prairie, grass, is, not, destroyed, by, fire, and, ittherefore, could, not, so, completely, eradicate, the, roots, of, those, enormoustrees, which, grow, upon, the, western, land, There, is, nothing, in, a, prairieland, to, prevent, the, growth, of, trees, as, wherever, the, fire, is, checkedthey, immediately, spring, up, The, rivers, also, protect, their, trees, fromfire, Prairie, land, occupies, two, thirds, of, the, State, of, Illinois, the, dearth, ofwater, and, wood, and, stone, will, prevent, them, from, being, settled, verythickly, except, in, the, vicinity, of, the, rivers, so, that, these, beautifulplains, will, long, remain, undisturbed, to, gratify, the, traveller, ’s, eye, Theprairies, would, of, course, be, underlain, with, coal, as, this, great, mass, ofvegetation, which, has, been, destroyed, by, the, floods, which, have, stood, uponthem, pressed, beneath, the, incumbent, strata, and, exposed, to, heatmoisture, and, pressure, will, produce, fermentation, and, afterwardshardened, strata, accordingly, it, is, found, that, coal, is, universal, everywhere, in, the, west, Why, should, we, stop, at137, second, causes, in, consideringthe, origin, of, prairies, why, speak, of, Indian, fires, or, rushing, floodsThe, Almighty, mind, who, hath, conceived, this, admirable, globe, and, who, withsuch, infinite, taste, hath, formed, and, beautified, it, decking, it, withflowers, and, every, other, delight, has, spread, out, this, fair, western, worldwith, lakes, immense, and, stately, forests, wondrous, cataracts, smilingprairies, and, broad, rolling, rivers, to, decorate, the, abode, of, His, lovedalthough, erring, sons, He, in, his, wisdom, foresaw, the, time, would, comewhen, the, exhausted, soil, and, crumbling, institutions, and, crowded, homesof, the, old, world, would, require, a, new, field, for, its, overgrownpopulation, and, held, this, world, perdu, beneath, the, ocean, caves, until, thefitting, moment, When, the, hour, had, come, it, arose, fresh, and, blossomingfrom, the, sea, adorned, with, a, goodly, variety, of, mountain, lake, fairplain, and, noble, river, to, compensate, the, lonely, wanderer, for, the, homehe, has, been, forced, to, leave, Now, is, not, that, a, pretty, theory, That, thiscontinent, was, much, longer, submerged, beneath, the, diluvial, flood, and, isindeed, a, new, world, is, I, believe, generally, conceded, by, geologistsThere, is, something, delightful, to, look, upon, the, earth, as, we, do, here, inits, pristine, glory, and, virgin, freshness, The, waters, may, have, lingeredlonger, upon, the, broad, valley, which, lies, between, the, Alleghany, and, Rockymountains, depositing, that, rich, alluvion, which, lies, so, deep, upon, theland, and, when, departing, ploughed, its, way, through, those, great, valleyswhere, now, the, western, rivers, flow, It, was, then, perhaps, before, thedeluge, the, abode, of, that, monstrous, saurian, race, some, sixty, feet, inlength, whose, bones, are, now, dug, up, in, Texas, and138, must, be, under, thesoil, When, their, ‘, days, were, fulfilled, ’, they, were, destroyed, and, sankbeneath, the, floods, to, harden, in, the, limestone, and, when, the, land, hadbecome, dry, the, mastodon, arose, and, stalked, over, the, western, plains, forsince, he, has, been, discovered, buried, in, the, soil, of, Missouri, with, Indianarrows, sticking, in, his, flesh, he, is, proved, not, to, be, antediluvial, Whenhis, career, was, over, the, Indian, tribes, were, admitted, into, the, new, bornworld, and, whatever, interest, we, may, take, in, their, fate, —, however, we, maypity, them, we, must, all, agree, they, have, misused, their, gift, Their, talentwas, hid, the, fields, were, untilled, the, stores, of, marbles, and, metalsand, materials, choice, and, rare, which, were, placed, there, that, man, mightrear, him, a, comfortable, habitation, and, lordly, temples, for, his, Godremained, unknown, in, their, secret, deposites, The, Indian, was, doomed, toshare, the, fate, of, the, mammoth, the, barrier, which, concealed, this, worldfrom, the, older, part, was, loosed, and, the, waves, of, human, population, thatrolled, over, it, has, pushed, back, the, Indians, step, by, step, and, thinnedtheir, ranks, and, will, thin, them, until, their, race, also, lies, under, thesoil, whose, riches, they, knew, not, how, to, use, It, is, a, singular, and, interesting, thing, to, stand, as, I, do, now, upon, theconfines, of, the, earth, as, it, were, ‘, at, the, green, earth, ’s, end, ’, and, gazeback, through, the, vista, of, time, over, Europe, and, Africa, and, Asia, uponthe,

themachinery, of, world, making, at, work, —, to, behold, the, progress, of, societygoing, on, under, your, eyes, from, its, infancy, to, its, maturity, As, in, apanorama, we, behold, the, wigwam, of,

below, us, over, which, two, bright, rivers, werewinding, the, Fox, and, the, Des, Plaines, which, meeting, formed, a, broad, andnoble, stream, which, runs, 220, miles, from, this, spot, to, the, MississippiThe, Illinois, first, takes, that, name, here, The, plain, was, bounded, in, thedistance, by, groves, of, stately, trees, and, by, the, bluffs, of, the, IllinoisIn, the, centre, of, this, fair, valley, just, where, the, ‘, bright, waters, meet’is, the, little, town, of, Ottowa, It, is, youngling, just, come, out, andcontains, only, 1006, inhabitants, but, is, rapidly, increasing, A, gentledescent, of, about, a, mile, brought, us, to, the, banks, of, the, Fox, beneath, theshadow, of, the, shrub140bery, which, fringed, its, shores, we, drove, some, timefollowing, its, windings, and, gazing, at, the, bright, sheen, of, its, watersglittering, through, the, foliage, We, forded, it, twice, while, crossing, thevalley, and, so, pure, and, transparent, was, the, stream, that, the, pebbleswhich, lay, upon, the, sandstone, floor, could, be, seen, as, distinctly, as, inthe, hand, The, canal, passes, here, and, the, workmen, were, building, ahandsome, viaduct, across, the, stream, The, Fox, river, is, here, about, 100yards, wide, but, is, low, at, this, season, It, rises, in, Wisconsin, and, isnavigable, to, within, fifteen, miles, of, lake, Michigan, near, Milwaukie, Manyparts, of, its, shore, are, richly, wooded, The, rapids, upon, the, stream, afforda, great, amount, of, water, power, serviceable, for, machinery, A, short, driveafter, again, crossing, the, Fox,

neighboring, papersamused, us, until, the, stage, horn, sounded, —, we, entered, our, stage, —, theleaders, were, touched, and, we, bade, adieu, to, Ottowa, I, fear, forever, Ishall, not, soon, forget, that, lovely, purple, evening, which, threw, such, acharm, over, the, scenery, as, we, drove, from, Ottowa, to, Peru, a, distance, offifteen, miles, Our, road, lay, beside, the, bright, Illinois, upon, prairie, orbottom, land, which, lines, each, side, of, the, river, throughout, its, wholelength, making, a, valley, from, one, to, five, miles, broad, skirted, with, highlimestone, and, sandstone, bluffs, The, ground, was, gay, with, flowers, and, asthe, twilight, threw, its, purple, haze, over, the, opposite, shore, it, becamealive, with, hundreds, of, brilliant, fire, flies, larger, and, more, luminousthan, any, I142, had, ever, seen, Many, a, time, have, you, and, I, sat, in, our, earlydays, upon, the, banks, of, the, Passaic, watching, these, brilliant, creaturesas, they, starred, the, black, robe, of, night, but, we, never, beheld, them, solarge, and, dazzling, as, these, western, lights, The, river, was, as, smooth, asa, mirror, upon, which, was, reflected, the, trees, and, rocks, with, perfectdistinctness, but, it, had, a, darker, hue, than, those, bright, waters, we, hadpassed, being, tinted, with, a, brownish, topaz, I, remarked, this, to, mycompanion, who, attributed, its, dark, shade, to, the, alluvion, and, black, mouldthrough, which, it, flowed, ‘, It, can, not, be, wholesome, ’, I, said, ‘, I, should, notlike, to, drink, it, ’, ‘, I, guess, if, you, had, been, on, top, of, that, rock, threehundred, years, ago, ’, said, an, old, man, who, sat, opposite, me, peering, out, thestage, at, the, opposite, bluffs, ‘, you, ’d, been, glad, to, drink, it, ever, so, muddyor, unhealthy, ’, I, opened, my, eyes, and, stared, enquiringly, at, him, ‘, That’sthe, rock, where, the, Ingins, were, starved, to, death, ’, he, said, in, answer, tomy, look, ‘, Indeed, ’, I, exclaimed, ‘, Is, that, starved, rock, ’, Our, heads, wereout, the, window, and, we, looked, with, much, interest, upon, the, scene, of, thatIndian, tragedy, A, high, cliff, of, alternate, sandstone, and, limestonelayers, stands, out, like, a, turret, from, the, rocky, bluffs, one, hundred, andforty, feet, above, the, river, —, it, was, spotted, with, moss, and, fringed, withtrees, which, the, sun, ’s, last, rays, had, tinged, with, gold, and, amber, androse, ‘, Yes, ma’am, that, ’s, the, rock, ’, continued, our, fellow, traveller‘Down, to, the, river, they, sunk, their, kettles, with, bark, ropes, in, hopes, ofgetting, water, but, the, cruel, Pottawattamies, cut, the, strings, and, so, theydied, ’, And, so, they, died, What, images, of, anguish, sorrow, rage, anddespair, does, that, short, sentence, convey, to, our, minds143, The, fate, of, the, unhappy, band, of, Illini, who, dwelt, in, the, fair, land, whichhas, taken, their, name, has, been, related, by, Schoolcraft, and, Flint, but, asI, think, you, have, not, seen, their, works, I, will, tell, it, you, The, Illiniwere, defeated, in, battle, by, the, Pottowattamies, and, retreated, to, the, topof, this, rock, which, by, a, narrow, ledge, joins, the, land, This, spot, theydefended, some, time, but, at, length, their, provisions, and, water, failedThey, scorned, to, surrender, but, one, by, one, lay, down, in, dignifiedcomposure, and, like, Cæsar, drawing, their, mantles, over, them, died, insilence, The, last, one, who, had, defended, the, rock, at, length, expired, andthe, enemy, seeing, no, one, appear, entered, the, stronghold, to, find, them, allat, rest, Their, bones, repose, there, now, The, rock, is, passed, and, upon, theprairie, at, our, right, we, behold, the, brazen, glare, of, a, fire, lighting, up, adozen, dark, figures, which, are, flitting, around, it, This, is, an, emigrantbivouac, Some, of, their, wagons, taken, from, their, wheels, shelter, the, centerwhere, the, men, repose, the, women, and, children, remain, in, the, othervehicles, A, fire, in, the, midst, keeps, off, the, moschetoes, and, perhaps, aprairie, wolf, thus, affording, under, the, mild, sky, a, comfortable, place, ofrepose, without, the, expense, of, a, hotel, The, prairie, grass, forms, a, softbed, for, the, men, and, food, for, the, cattle, ‘, I, reckon, the, Ottowa, folks, are, pretty, considerably, nettled, ’, said, ourold, traveller, in, a, voice, which, rendered, ‘, night, hideous, ’, with, itsharshness, ‘, They, thought, the, canal, would, end, there, and, they, would, gitall, the, trade, ’, ‘, The, Ottowa, folks, do, n’t, depend, on, no, canals, I, guess’replied, another, passenger, apparently, a, neighboring, farmer, taking, upthe, cudgels, for,

much, to, my, comfort, Soon, after, we, found, ourselves, in, themidst, of, a, group, of, Irish, shantees, occupied, by, the, canal, laborersflanked, by, a, row, of, low, wooden, tenements, upon, the, bank, of, themoonillumined, Illinois, ‘, This, ladies, and, gentlemen, ’, said, the, farmerin, a, tone, of, derision, ‘, is, the, grand, town, of, Peru, ’, ‘, Yes, and, biggerthan, Ottawa, was, when, it, was, as, newly, settled, as, Peru, ’, answered, thePeruvian, disdainfully, As, I, looked, around, me, I, thought, of, Tinkervilleand, its, public, square, in, the, forest, but, every, thing, must, have, abeginning, The, steamboat, frontier, was, waiting, to, receive, us, and, we, weresoon, with, our, luggage, translated, to, her, deck, Fatigued, as, we, were, wecould, not, leave, the, deck, for, some, time, for, the, night, sun, as, theIndians, call, the, moon, was, shining, brightly, down, upon, the, smooth, surfaceof, the, Illinois, lighting, up, her, forest, glades, as, we145, passed, andthrowing, fantastic, shadows, over, the, silver, water, However, a, night, and, aday, in, a, stage, coach, has, beaten, all, romance, out, of, us, and, we, at, lengthretreated, to, our, snug, stateroom, The, mosquitoe, nets, were, drawn, over, usand, we, soon, bid, to, nature, and, to, you, a, fair, goodnight146, Peoria, July, 8th, My, dear, E, —, We, were, detained, during, the, night, by, a, heavy, fog, andinstead, of, reaching, Peoria, at, six, found, at, breakfast, we, were, many, milesthis, side, of, it, Breakfast, over, I, have, seated, myself, upon, the, guards, asort, of, balcony, which, runs, around, the, outside, of, the, steamboat, and, withnotebook, in, hand, am, prepared, to, give, you, a, faithful, picture, of, all, Isee, The, river, is, still, and, bright, reflecting, every, little, twig, andleaf, There, is, no, villa, or, ruins, or, lordly, mansion, to, embellish, thescenery, but, it, is, indebted, to, its, wild, forests, alone, for, itsloveliness, It, flows, and, bends, in, a, very, graceful, manner, around, the, softgreen, islets, or, low, points, fringed, with, trees, of, new, and, unknown, formand, beauty, Frowning, above, the, trees, in, the, back, ground, are, the, cliffswaterworn, as, if, once, the, river, ’s, ancient, bound, Occasionally, our, tracklay, close, to, the, shore, and, we, gazed, into, the, forest, ’s, deep, recessesnow, a, dark, jungle, is, before, us, haunt, of, the, wolf, and, the, panther, andagain, a147, noble, grove, of, witch, elms, or, long, vistas, through, which, theearly, morning, sun, was, streaming, or, a, patch, of, brilliant, smooth, swardsurrounded, by, a, circle, of, trees, the, papaw, or, the, silvery, barked, whitemaple, its, bright, green, leaves, turning, up, their, silver, lining, to, thebreeze, Sometimes, a, little, bay, appeared, between, two, promontoriescovered, with, yellow, and, white, water, lillies, and, the, perfumed, nympheaodorata, the, home, of, the, swan, or, the, wild, fowl, The, willow, here, occursfrequently, dipping, its, leaves, in, the, stream, sometimes, the, shiningwillow, with, its, long, and, slender, brilliant, leaves, The, locust, isfrequent, many, varieties, of, oak, the, red, bud, cotton, wood, and, manyother, trees, festooned, with, vines, of, every, tint, and, variety, I, wished, much, to, see, a, prairie, wolf, and, looked, out, eagerly, among, theforests, in, vain, Just, now, a, man, who, was, looking, to, the, shore, exclaimed‘There, ’s, a, wolf, ’, he, pointed, to, the, spot, where, some, dark, animal, wascowering, under, a, log, My, companion, declared, it, was, a, pig, and, some, oneelse, a, dog, whatever, it, was, it, soon, run, away, into, the, forest, Ideclared, it, should, be, a, wolf, and, to, please, me, it, was, unanimously, voteda, prairie, wolf, A, deer, I, looked, for, in, vain, the, noise, made, by, ourpuffing, high, pressure, engine, being, sufficient, to, scare, every, animalaway, from, our, path, We, passed, Hennepin, during, the, night, and, thismorning, Lacon, and, Rome, both, small, places, situated, upon, those, elevatedbanks, or, plateaus, which, alternate, with, the, woodlands, along, the, riverThe, two, first, are, both, in, Putman, county, containing, two, hundred, andfiftytwo, square, miles, and, a, population, of, two, thousand, one, hundredand148, thirtyone, The, stream, which, had, become, narrower, about, a, quarterof, a, mile, in, width, now, swelled, out, in, an, expanse, two, miles, broad, andtwenty, long, called, Peoria, lake, by, the, indians, Pinatawee, It, aboundswith, fish, we, were, told, as, sturgeon, buffalo, perch, pickerel, and, catfish, and, the, alligator, garr, seven, feet, long, covered, with, scales, theformer, we, had, often, seen, during, the, morning, spring, from, the, water, andplunge, back, again, leaving, a, silvery, circle, growing, wider, and, wider, uponthe, polished, surface, of, the, river, The, water, was, now, unruffled, by, aripple, the, shore, at, our, left, covered, with, forests, throwing, theirshadows, over, the, water, while, upon, a, high, bank, at, our, right, was, thepretty, town, of, Peoria, It, was, a, very, sweet, and, tranquil, picture, Thishas, ever, been, a, favorite, haunt, of, the, Indians, and, French, In, 1779, avillage, stood, here, called, La, Ville, de, Maillet, inhabited, by, Frenchcourier, des, bois, Indian, hunters, and, fur, traders, a, stopping, place, forthe, French, upon, the, lakes, and, their, settlements, on, the, MississippiSubsequently, Fort, Clarke, was, erected, here, for, the, United, States, troopsand, now, a, pretty, town, with, six, houses, of, worship, several, acadamiesmarket, houses, shops, hotels, breweries, mills, and, dwellings, and, ahandsome, courthouse, with, pillared, portico, and, tin, covered, cupola, havearisen, upon, the, bank, The, shore, is, composed, of, pebbles, about, twentyfeet, high, extending, back, one, quarter, of, a, mile, where, another, step, ofsix, or, ten, feet, brings, you, to, a, fine, prairie, leading, to, the, bluffs, Arow, of, buildings, surmounted, the, banks, principally, shops, but, among, themwe, observed, several, small, taverns, as, the, Napoleon, Coffee, House, UnionHotel, and, Washington, Hall, Upon, a, brick149, house, farther, in, town, mycompanion, espied, the, sign, of, the, Clinton, Hotel, which, being, the, house, towhich, he, had, been, recommended, he, accepted, the, services, of, the, portersof, that, establishment, who, with, those, of, the, other, houses, had, beensoliciting, his, custom, How, to, land, was, the, next, consideration, for, uponrivers, which, have, so, great, a, rise, and, fall, it, is, difficult, to, constructwharves, After, grounding, backing, fastening, a, stake, in, the, mud, for, arope, which, immediately, came, out, again, we, were, at, last, stationary, Aplank, was, then, projected, to, the, shore, down, which, we, were, all, trundledWe, had, now, reached, the, end, of, our, journey, one, hundred, and, seventy, milesfrom, Chicago, and, took, leave, of, the, Chicago, line, being, left, to, our, owndevices, to, wander, farther, We, found, the, Clinton, hotel, a, good, house, andcharges, low, being, only, one, dollar, and, twentyfive, cents, a, day, each, Thehost, is, a, very, gentlemanly, person, and, the, ladies, of, the, family, welleducated, and, agreeable, We, partook, of, a, very, good, dinner, of, nativeproduce, even, to, the, wild, raspberry, tarts, which, appeared, at, desert, Ilike, this, much, more, than, being, fed, upon, foreign, dainties, which, one, canprocure, any, where, There, was, a, picture, in, our, dining, room, which, was, acomplete, sign, of, the, times, upon, it, was, painted, a, cider, barrel, fromwhich, a, man, was, drawing, ‘, hard, cider, ’, bearing, the, motto, ‘, Old, Tip’sclaims, to, the, White, House, can, not, be, jumped, ’, This, had, been, borne, as, abanner, by, the, Peoria, delegation, at, the, whig, convention, of, Fort, Meigs, Ifone, might, judge, by, what, one, sees, Gen, Harrison, will, have, the, votes, ofall, the, west, as, he, seems, to, be, very, popular, as, far, as, we, have, beenUpon, returning, to, the, parlor, we, found, a, centre, table150, containingannuals, and, several, excellent, volumes, of, the, best, authors, bearing, thenames, of, the, young, ladies, of, the, house, While, I, looked, over, these, mycompanion, took, up, the, Peoria, Democrat, and, expressed, his, surprise, to, seesuch, a, paper, in, so, new, a, place, and, in, it, such, proofs, of, the, trade, ofthe, place, The, type, and, paper, were, as, good, as, any, in, our, city, andcontained, advertisements, of, goods, drugs, wines, fruits, and, otherarticles, which, makes, one, wonder, how, such, things, could, find, their, waythere, Another, column, explains, this, where, are, notices, of, steamboatswhich, ply, between, this, place, and, St, Louis, but, three, or, four, daysvoyage, to, New, Orleans, consequently, one, may, command, any, thing, here, Inthree, years, the, Michigan, canal, will, be, finished, which, will, open, acommunication, with, the, Atlantic, through, the, lakes, and, the, New, Yorkcanals, Peoria, can, not, fail, of, being, a, place, of, much, business, forbesides, the, above, named, advantages, the, land, around, it, is, rich, prairieinterspersed, with, wood, land, or, timber, as, they, call, it, here, crossed, byseveral, mill, streams, It, is, but, seventy, miles, from, Springfield, thecapitol, of, Illinois, a, large, and, handsome, town, doing, a, great, deal, ofbusiness, and, situated, in, the, celebrated, county, of, Sangamon, Over, the, level, country, around, Peoria, good, roads, are, laid, out, in, everydirection, A, railroad, is, in, contemplation, from, hence, to, the, Mississippiat, Warsaw, while, another, the, Bloomington, and, Peoria, railroad, is, soonto, be, laid, down, from, this, to, the, Mackinaw, river, forty, miles, It, is, onthe, high, road, from, the, gulf, of, Mexico, to, the, north, and, alreadytravellers, are, taking, this, route, to, the, eastern, States, We, found151, here, ayoung, lady, and, her, father, who, had, come, from, Mobile, They, left, there, in, asteamboat, for, New, Orleans, from, thence, other, steamboats, brought, them, upthe, Mississippi, to, Quincy, from, whence, they, rode, in, a, stage, to, PeoriaThey, were, on, their, way, to, New, York, and, had, taken, this, rout, from, itsnovelty, In, the, afternoon, we, ramble, down, to, the, shores, where, I, foundsome, very, pretty, pieces, of, agate, jasper, and, other, pretty, pebbles, andgathered, several, singular, shells, and, flowers, The, shells, wereprincipally, large, muscle, lined, with, pearl, some, of, them, beautifullyirredescent, A, neat, cottage, on, the, bank, with, its, door, open, looked, soinviting, that, we, ventured, to, enter, and, ask, for, a, glass, of, water, Thewoman, willingly, filled, a, pitcher, from, a, cool, spring, near, and, invited, usto, sit, down, She, looked, ill, and, the, children, around, her, were, thin, andpale, I, asked, her, the, cause, and, heard, a, sad, story, of, fever, and, aguesickness, They, had, removed, from, Pennsylvania, and, had, all, been, ill, assoon, as, they, arrived, but, had, hopes, of, being, after, a, while, acclimatedThe, cause, of, their, sickness, was, as, usual, their, exposure, to, the, heavyfogs, which, arise, from, this, river, at, night, which, strangers, should, avoidfor, a, year, at, least, —, and, probably, other, imprudence, Her, husband, was, acarpenter, who, had, sufficient, employment, where, they, had, lived, and, therethey, were, well, and, happy, To, my, question, of, the, cause, of, their, removalshe, answered, ‘, Oh, he, had, heard, of, the, west, where, every, one, is, sure, toget, rich, and, so, he, came, ’, Most, of, the, emigrants, we, have, met, with, couldgive, us, no, better, reason, for, removing, hither, than, this, woman, They, hearthe, west, spoken, of, as, a, great, rich, and, rising, country152, pull, up, theirhousehold, by, the, roots, and, ‘, westward, hold, their, way, ’, I, believe, no, onebut, our, people, can, thus, readily, leave, their, homes, and, the, graves, oftheir, fathers, to, seek, a, residence, in, new, and, untried, regions, Among, theemigrants, we, were, often, surprised, to, see, so, many, from, the, neighboringStates, Hoffman, met, a, man, during, his, ‘, winter, in, the, west, ’, who, hadremoved, his, household, from, one, end, of, the, State, of, Michigan, to, theother, merely, because, the, mould, was, a, foot, richer, at, Kalamazoo, —, his, ownbeing, eighteen, inches, A, man, removes, from, the, eastern, border, to, the, westof, Pennsylvania, Perhaps, he, there, erects, a, house, and, in, a, few, years, seesa, good, farm, around, him, another, wishing, to, remove, west, offers, him, a, sumfor, it, so, much, larger, than, his, original, outlay, that, he, is, tempted, tosell, and, emigrate, farther, west, He, with, this, money, purchases, a, place, ofa, man, in, Ohio, who, sells, in, the, same, way, and, passes, on, In, a, few, yearsthe, Pensylvanian, again, sells, and, again, removes, so, that, there, is, aconstant, stream, going, step, by, step, to, fill, up, the, immense, plains, andvalleys, which, here, abound, Fashions, for, emigration, prevail, a, placebecomes, popular, every, one, is, excited, by, the, accounts, of, this, newDorado, and, westward, ho, is, the, cry, Boon, ’s, Lick, in, Missouri, Saltriver, Platte, river, Oregon, Rock, river, Wisconsin, Michigan, and, Iowaeach, have, had, its, run, and, its, partisans, But, there, is, ‘, more, than, meetsthe, ear, ’, in, this, fortunately, their, destinies, are, not, left, to, theguidance, of, their, own, variable, fancies, There, is, an, overruling, Power, atwhose, command, their, steps, are, hither, bent, When, I, see, them, on, theirmarch, people, from, every, nation, men, women, and, little, ones, and, cattlewinding, down153, the, road, in, their, wagons, filling, the, steamboats, andcrowding, the, stages, all, pressing, in, large, bodies, towards, the, land, ofmilk, and, honey, they, remind, me, of, the, Hebrews, plucked, up, from, anovergrown, country, and, led, with, an, Almighty, hand, to, the, land, ofpromise, May, these, travellers, study, the, eventful, journey, of, thePalestine, emigrants, and, shun, those, errors, by, which, they, were, drivenforth, from, its, fair, fields, The, Hebrews, were, told, if, they, would, obeytheir, heavenly, leader, ‘, the, land, shall, yield, her, increase, and, the, treesof, the, field, shall, yield, their, fruit’—and, ‘, ye, shall, eat, your, bread, tothe, full, and, dwell, in, the, land, safely, ’, and, ‘, ye, shall, lie, down, and, noneshall, make, you, afraid, ’, ‘, I, will, be, your, God, and, ye, shall, be, mypeople’17, What, magnificent, promises, And, how, powerful, the, promiserOh, that, these, people, would, lay, these, words, to, their, heart, and, considerwell, the, Hebrew, ’s, fate, They, were, also, promised, to, be, made, ‘, high, aboveall, nations, which, He, hath, made, in, praise, in, name, and, in, honor’18There, be, those, who, predict, this, for, our, country, let, these, read, theconditions, by, which, this, maybe, obtained, and, dread, curses19, whichawait, a, failure, We, continued, our, stroll, back, of, the, town, across, theprairie, or, steppe, upon, which, it, is, built, to, another, about, twelve, orfifteen, feet, above, it, From, thence, is, a, fine, plateau, which, reaches, tothe, bluffs, As, we, sat, upon, this, eminence, the, view, was, very, pretty, Thesun, had, been, long, gone, but, a, delicate, amber, shaded, with, purple, tintedevery, thing, Below, us, was, the, green, prairie, crossed, with, dark, purplepaths, over, which, the, ‘, lowing, herds, ’, were, winding, slowly, as, if, loth, toleave, their, free, pastures154, for, the, confinement, of, a, barn, yard, Thecattle, raised, upon, prairie, grass, are, very, fat, and, the, Illinois, beefcommands, a, ready, sale, in, the, New, Orleans, markets, The, butter, and, milk, wemet, with, here, was, uncommonly, rich, equal, to, our, first, rate, Goshenbutter, Beyond, the, prairie, is, the, town, beneath, which, flows, the, quietIllinois, bounded, by, dark, forests, and, elevated, bluffs, While, we, werethus, sitting, enjoying, the, ‘, coming, on, of, grateful, evening, mild, ’, the, deepsilence, was, broken, by, the, sweet, sound, of, a, church, bell, echoing, over, theriver, and, the, still, forests, At, once, these, words, of, Milton, so, veryappropriate, to, our, situation, sprang, to, our, lips, There, was, apparently, an, evening, meeting, about, to, be, held, and, werejoiced, we, should, be, enabled, to, enter, the, courts, of, the, Lord, aprivilege, we, had, been, denied, for, some, time, Our, path, to, the, town, laypast, several, very, pretty, cottage, residences, ornamented, with, shrubberyand, flowers, —, thence, following, the, sound, of, the, bell, we, found, ourselvesbefore, a, small,

pleasingintelligent, and, pious, man, We, were, very, much, gratified, with, hisdiscourse, which, we, found, very, appropriate, He, spoke, of, man, as, atraveller, the, end, of, whose, journey, must, certainly, one, day, approach, andearnestly, bade, us, to, take, thought, for, that, event, as, there, were, manythere, who, ‘, before, the, frost, is, spread, over, our, prairie, may155, be,

This, last, yeartwentythree, thousand, dollars, were, contributed, by, the, people, of, Peoriatowards, charitable, and, religious, institutions, We, walked, home, under, abright, moon, our, hearts,

along, the, shore, this, morning, we, descriedthe, smoke, of, our, expected, steamboat, and, hastened, back, to, the, hotel, topack, our, trunks, It, was, the, Home, from, Peru, to, St, Louis, and, we, were, totake, passage, in, her, for, Alton, on, the, Mississippi, We, bade, adieu, tosweet, Peoria, with, regret, The, remembrance, of, it, will, long, ‘, perfume, ourminds, ’, as, old, Izaak, Walton, says, Its, situation, its, excellent, societyand, religious, privileges, and, its, good, schools, must, certainly, make, it, adesirable, place, of, residence, or, of, trade, It, is, two, hundred, miles, fromSt, Louis, and, one, hundred, and, seventy, from, Chicago, When, in, the, saloonof, the, Home, we, were, presented, with, a, book, in, which, to, write, our, namesplace, of, residence, whither, bound, and, our, politics, While, leavingthis, our, eyes, fell, upon, a, piece, of, pink, satin, framed, which, hungagainst, the, wall, upon, which, was, printed, the, rules, of, the, boat, Amongother, things, it, forbid, ‘, any, gentleman, to, go, to, table, without, his156, coator, any, other, garb, to, disturb, the, company, No, gentleman, must, pencilworkor, otherwise, injure, the, furniture, ’, I, suppose, whittling, was, meant, Uponour, lake, boat, we, saw, the, boxes, of, merchandize, and, barrels, on, deck, fastdisappearing, under, the, whittling, knife, A, piece, a, foot, long, and, twoinches, wide, would, be, torn, from, the, box, and, cut, to, pieces, by, a, restlesspassenger, Beside, these, we, were, told, ‘, no, gentleman, was, to, lie, down, ina, berth, with, his, boots, on, and, none, enter, the, ladies, ’, saloon, withoutpermission, from, them, ’, We, found, in, this, boat, three, indications, of, beingnear, the, south, liquors, upon, the, table, gambling, in, the, gentlemen’scabin, and, a, black, chambermaid, slave, to, the, captain, Among, thepassengers, were, a, man, with, his, wife, and, sons, unlike, the, most, I, hadmet, going, west, but, making, a, retrograde, motion, to, the, east, They, weredriven, away, they, said, by, the, fever, and, ague, from, which, they, had, beensuffering, ever, since, their, removal, west, Their, yellow, gaunt, appearancefully, testified, to, the, truth, of, this, He, had, been, a, shop, keeper, in, theState, of, New, York, who, experiencing, some, reverses, was, persuaded, toremove, to, this, golden, region, by, his, wife, who, was, now, no, longer, able, tolead, the, village, fashions, He, bought, a, lot, and, mill, privilege, in, anembryo, town, —, their, house, was, situated, under, the, boughs, of, a, forestimpenetrable, to, the, sunbeams, surrounded, by, decaying, leaves, moist, newsoil, and, a, mill, pond, The, town, ’s, people, were, too, busily, occupied, inbuilding, banks, and, hotels, to, dig, wells, and, drinking, out, of, the, marshysprings, of, course, all, fell, ill, by, turns, Their, boy, they, said, had, beenat, ‘, death, ’s, door, ’, and, now, although, better, was, afflicted, with, an, aguecake, which, they, wished, me157, to, feel, in, his, side, I, am, convinced, alittle, prudence, and, knowledge, will, keep, many, ‘, healthy, wealthy, andwise, ’, who, without, it, are, easily, discouraged, fall, into, difficultiesand, wish, to, try, a, new, place, We, have, met, many, upon, the, road, who, havenearly, equalled, the, old, woman, on, the, prairie, who, had, begun, the, worldseven, times, The, other, female, passenger, was, a, young, girl, who, had, come, down, the, riverin, the, boat, her, home, being, on, the, prairie, back, of, Peru, She, was, apretty, innocent, country, lassie, about, sixteen, travelling, alone, on, avisit, to, a, brother, living, on, the, river, whose, wife, was, ill, and, requiredher, services, Her, travelling, dress, was, a, muslin, striped, with, pink, andher, hat, one, of, that, description, we, call, Dutch, bonnets, made, ofpasteboard, covered, with, pink, glazed, gingham, She, was, rejoiced, to, examinemy, wardrobe, and, cut, new, patterns, as, she, lives, far, from, the, haunts, ofmen, and, mantuamakers, My, Mosaic, brooch, pleased, her, much, and, she, askedme, if, I, had, bought, it, of, the, pedlar, who, she, heard, had, lately, arrived, inthat, part, of, the, country, with, a, lot, of, new, goods, and, whom, she, was, eagerto, see, I, was, obliged, to, say, I, had, not, purchased, it, from, thatfashionable, depositary, She, then, proposed, to, show, me, her, clothes, minebeing, new, to, her, she, supposed, her, ’s, must, be, new, and, desirable, to, me, Ather, request, the, chambermaid, drew, from, the, stateroom, a, huge, chest, ofblack, walnut, which, she, opened, and, among, other, things, displayed, apretty, straw, bonnet, trimmed, with, gay, ribbons, and, flowers, That, was, herSunday, bonnet, She, also, drew, forth, a, topaz, pin, which, had, reached, here, ina, pedlar, ’s, cart, and, was, a, present, to, her, by, her, brother, ‘, This, pin, haslasted158, wonderfully, ’, she, said, ‘, considering, how, much, it, has, beenborrowed, At, every, dance, or, party, when, I, do, not, go, some, of, the, girlsborrow, and, wear, it, It, has, been, lent, for, ten, miles, around, ’, This, younglady, had, been, brought, when, quite, young, by, her, family, from, Ohio, whencethey, emigrated, here, They, had, all, suffered, much, from, the, fever, and, aguebut, were, now, acclimated, or, rather, had, corrected, the, causes, of, theiragues, and, she, had, become, fat, and, rosy, I, have, remarked, in, severalinstances, that, the, children, born, here, or, brought, here, young, grow, upstrong, and, ruddy, and, their, parents, suffer, the, most, It, is, only, thefirst, generation, who, lose, their, health, as, the, land, improves, anddiseases, vanish, about, their, homes, by, the, time, their, children, are, grownThis, family, live, upon, a, large, and, productive, farm, which, yields, amongother, things, according, to, her, account, four, hundred, bushels, of, peachesIn, the, season, of, this, delicious, fruit, her, mother, gives, a, peach, feastinviting, all, their, friends, and, acquaintances, who, after, eating, as, muchas, they, like, carry, away, each, a, basket, full, Her, family, sell, severalbarrels, of, dried, peaches, every, year, Twelve, miles, below, Peoria, we, stopped, at, the, town, of, Pekin, built, upon, abank, elevated, fifteen, feet, above, the, water, during, high, tide, but, nowall, these, places, are, much, higher, The, captain, told, us, he, should, be, heresome, time, taking, in, merchandize, and, we, employed, the, interval, in, seeingthe, lions, of, the, town, I, told, the, little, country, girl, our, intention‘Lions, ’, she, said, ‘, I, guess, you, mean, wolves, there, are, no, lions, in, theseparts, ’, Pekin, is, a, small, place, and, only, contains, eight, or159, nine, hundredinhabitants, and, five, or, six, streets, The, shops, seemed, well, filled, withgoods, and, presented, a, goodly, show, of, tin, ironware, drygoodscrockery, provisions, etc, I, purchased, a, green, gauze, veil, here, andseveral, small, articles, all, of, which, I, found, much, more, expensive, than, inour, Atlantic, shops, freight, being, high, on, the, Mississippi, In, paying, forthem, I, found, a, new, currency, here, my, shillings, and, sixpences, beingtransformed, into, bits, and, pics, or, picayunes, The, Pekin, Express, layupon, the, counter, which, we, amused, ourselves, looking, over, while, waitingfor, change, The, person, who, kept, the, shop, turned, out, to, be, the, oldestinhabitant, of, the, place, that, important, personage, who, in, a, stormalways, determines, if, there, has, been, ever, a, greater, one, or, no, He, mightvery, well, be, the, oldest, as, the,

thecommissioners, who, were, to, lay, it, out, these, pulling, different, ways, thetown, was, nearly, lost, between, them, The, rich, country, behind, and, theriver, in, front, had, befriended, them, and, they, soon, expected, to, havetheir, branch, of, the, railroad, finished, to, Mackinaw, river, whose, waterpower, and, timber, bluffs, were, very, valuable, ’, We, remarked, as, we, walked, alarge, hotel, nearly, finished, a, presbyterian, methodist, and, severalother, meetinghouses, office, of, the, ‘, Tazewell, Telegraph, ’, academy, andsome, dwellings, We, lay, here, four, hours, with, a, hot, sun, reflecting, fromthe, sandy, bank, impatiently, watching, the, barrels, of, flour, which, seemedas, they, would, never, cease, rolling, from, the, large, storehouse, upon, thebank, down, to, our, vessel, These, barrels, are160, from, the, steam, flour, millswhich, turn, out, two, hundred, barrels, a, day, Beside, these, we, took, in, ahundred, sacks, of, corn, and, some, other, merchandize, The, captain, seemedwell, pleased, with, his, morning, ’s, work, saying, he, had, a, streak, of, luckthat, day, Three, miles, below, this, he, had, another, ‘, streak, ’, At, the, mouthof, Mackinaw, river, scows, were, waiting, him, loaded, with, bundles, of, lathsand, staves, and, long, dark, boards, which, I, took, for, mahogany, but, whichproved, to, be, blackwalnut, The, Mackinaw, is, a, clear, stream, having, richbottom, land, bounded, by, bluffs, covered, with, white, oak, and, cedar, Theprairies, through, which, it, flows, are, rolling, and, tolerable, land, withseveral, mill, seats, The, Illinois, looked, beautiful, this, afternoon, Its, glassy, waters, scarcelymoved, and, it, seemed, so, content, with, its, sweet, resting, place, and, at, thesilent, admiration, of, those, stately, trees, which, were, sending, their, coolflickering, shadows, over, her, and, gazing, down, at, loveliness, that, it, wouldfain, linger, upon, its, course, as, some, young, languid, beauty, conscious, ofa, graceful, position, which, is, winning, admiring, glances, from, everybeholder, Among, the, trees, beside, the, usual, elm, oak, and, maple, we, observedseveral, enormous, wild, cherry, trees, nearly, one, hundred, feet, in, heightand, at, least, fifteen, feet, in, circumference, and, the, paw, paw, the, coffeenut, the, red, ash, American, nettle, a, tall, slender, tree, with, pretty, redberries, and, many, unknown, to, us, or, to, those, around, us, The, islands, inthis, river, are, small, but, covered, with, soft, luxurious, herbage, The, birdsand, wild, fowl, were, out, enjoying, themselves, chattering, pluming, theirwings, and, visiting, each161, other, from, tree, to, tree, Among, the, wild, fowlwe, observed, teal, and, brant, and, wild, ducks, skimming, over, the, water, orwheeling, in, flocks, over, our, heads, One, apparently, in, a, spirit, ofdaring, would, set, out, to, cross, our, path, —, leaving, his, little, cove, hewould, glide, with, the, utmost, rapidity, over, the, river, in, front, of, usleaving, a, silver, line, on, the, smooth, surface, of, the, stream, and, after, wehad, passed, glide, back, bobbing, up, and, down, upon, the, waves, in, our, wakeWhen, he, arrived, at, home, what, a, quacking, and, chattering, and, flutteringwas, heard, In, one, little, cove, or, bayou, was, a, little, island, coveredwith, rich, grass, and, shaded, from, the, sun, by, the, dense, grove, whosebranches, met, over, it, —, this, seemed, to, be, quite, a, colony, of, ducks, whowere, going, and, coming, in, rapid, but, graceful, evolutions, from, the, mainland, A, young, man, who, stood, near, us, named, the, place, Quackville, anddeclared, when, he, returned, home, he, would, publish, a, map, and, sell, off, thelots, We, passed, several, towns, to, day, as, Liverpool, HavannaBeardstown, —, the, former, a, small, settlement, but, which, its, inhabitantsintend, to, make, larger, as, they, have, already, a, railroad, in, contemplationacross, the, Mississippi, Beardstown, is, a, place, of, some, importance, It, isa, county, town, and, its, commerce, greater, than, any, upon, the,

from, Indiana, by, means, of, the, Sangamon, andVermillion162, forks, While, passing, these, towns, one, is, surprised, at, theirrapid, growth, for, when, Schoolcraft, rowed, his, canoe, up, this, river, twentyyears, since, it, was, a, wilderness, only, inhabited, by, Indians, OppositeHavanna, the, Spoon, river, enters, the, Illinois, Its, Indian, name, isAmequeon, which, means, ladle, and, is, much, prettier, than, its, presentname, It, is, one, hundred, and, forty, miles, in, length, navigable, most, of, theway, and, capable, of, being, cleared, further, The, soil, is, dry, undulatingprairie, with, considerable, timber, —, and, some, of, it, upon, the, forks, of, theSpoon, is, the, richest, in, the, state, —, its, forks, and, tributaries, affordinggood, mill, seats, It, is, in, the, military, bounty, land, which, commences, justabove, it, and, terminates, at, the, junction, of, the, Illinois, with, theMississippi, making, a, triangle, of, five, million, three, hundred, and, sixtythousand, acres, about, ninety, miles, along, the, Illinois, and, the, base, ofthe, triangle, ninety, miles, across, to, the, Mississippi, near, Quincy, Thisis, appropriated, by, Congress, to, the, soldiers, of, the, regular, army, in, thewar, between, the, United, States, and, Great, Britain, Two, thirds, of, this, landis, prairie, and, the, rest, timbered, crossed, by, a, variety, of, rivers, andcreeks, The, soil, is, generally, a, black, vegetable, mould, from, fifteen, tothirty, inches, deep, Much, of, the, best, of, this, land, has, been, bought, up, bya, company, who, have, opened, an, office, at, Quincy, where, they, sell, it, fromthree, to, ten, dollars, an, acre, while, other, parts, are, sold, at, the, pricegovernment, established, for, its, lands, all,

a, ramble, in, the, woods, said, ‘, we, had, goneto, walk, in, the, timber, ’, In, this, famed, county, is, Springfield, the, capitalof, the, State, The, Sangamon, river, is, one, hundred, and, eighty, miles, longand, navigable, nearly, to, the, capitol, seventyfive, miles, by, smallsteamboats, With, a, small, expense, it, can, be, cleared, We, do, not, see, theIllinois, in, all, its, grandeur, as, the, water, is, low, It, falls, our, captainsays, one, and, a, half, inches, a, day, and, has, fallen, eight, feet, since, JuneIt, will, arise, in, the, autumn, and, when, its, present,

Sangamon, we, stopped, to, take, in, wood, and, weembraced, the, opportunity, to, take, a, sunset, stroll, in, the, forest, A, smallcottage, embowered, among, woodpiles, inhabited, by, a, woodman,

Here, however, in, these, pretty, nooks, he, sits, undisturbed, for, no, boys‘with, crooks, and, bags, ’, can, molest, his, quiet, haunts, We, enjoyed, the, deepforest, walk, very, much, having, been, now, so, long, cramped, in, a, steamboatand, wandered, along, among, the, stately, beech, and, graceful, linden, theblack, walnut, and, locust, swung, upon, the, festoons, of, the, enormous, vineswhich, hung, down, from, the, trees, and, breathed, with, much, satisfaction, theperfume, from, the, dewy, herbage, grape, vine, buds, and, yellow, jassaminwhich, climbed, the, boughs, around, us, The, steamboat, bell, recalled, us, tothe, shore, in, time, to, see, a, steamboat, pass, being, the, second, we, had, metthis, morning, There, is, much, travelling, upon, this, river, during, the, summer, months, Ourcaptain, told, us, he, had, made, fiftyeight, trips, last, year, from, St, Louisto, Peru, carrying, ten, thousand, passengers, This, seems, a, great, numberbut, we, are, a, travelling, people, and, with, the, emigrants, going, west, itmay, be, true, I, am, chary, of, repeating, things, heard, upon, the, road, as, Iknow, my, country, people, delight, in, quizzing, travellers, I, have, had, someawful, examples, of, this, lately, sufficient, to, make, me, cautious, in, regardto, certain, tourists, from, abroad, to, this, country, and, when, told, any, thingdubious, remember, the, three, miles, of, roast, pig, the, drunken, ladies, ofBoston, the, piano, with, pantalets, upon, its, legs, the, canvass, bags, tohold, specie, in, times, of, bank,

woman, who, has, been, livingseveral, years, upon, this, river, She, was, so, rejoiced, to, see, a, slave, againthat, soon, she, and, Violette, our, chambermaid, became, quite, intimatefriends, She, frequently, borrowed, her, pipe, to, have, a, comfortable, smokeout, upon, the, guards, where, with, Violette, beside, her, she, would, smokeand, chat, for, hours, A, lady, on, board, who, had, lately, become, a, convert, totemperance, cause, was, extremely, offended, at, the, sight, of, spirits, uponthe, dining, table, Her, husband, argued, for, their, use, upon, the, ground, offrequent, impure, water, and, fever, and, ague, from, which, the, stomach, isfortified, The, wife, however, was, not, convinced, when, in, the, midst, of, ahigh, argument, our, old, woman, put, her, head, in, at, the, door, and, taking, outher, pipe, after, slowly, puffing, off, her, smoke, uttered, this, oracularsentence, ‘, For, my, part, I, think, there, are, lots, of, gnats, strained, at, andlots, of, camels, swallowed’—and, disappeared, The, husband, left, theargument, for, the, card, table, whence, he, arose, sometime, after, grumblingat, his, losses, and, galled, by, the, discovery, that, the, winner, was, a, wellknown, black, legg, whose, practice168, was, to, live, in, steamboats, duringsummer, to, fleece, such, silly, sheep, as, himself, In, the, winter, he, returnedupon, his, laurels,

unhealthy, coal, has, been, found, here, and, the, largetrees, are, famous, for, their, honey, As, we, were, near, the, mouth, of, theriver, and, my, little, fellow, voyager, Maria, had, not, yet, landed, I, askedher, how, far, we, were, from, her, brother, ’s, residence, She, said, she, had, beenlooking, out, for, it, but, every, place, had, a, different, name, from, that, ofher, brother, I, recommended, her, to, ask, the, captain, he, sent, her, word, we170had, passed, it, twenty, miles, back, Poor, Maria, seemed, overwhelmed, withconsternation, The, town, we, found, upon, enquiry, was, in, the, interior, thepassengers, landing, at, an, old, tree, upon, the, shore, and, we, all, nowremembered, a, plain, countryman, upon, the, bank, who, made, numerous, signs, tothe, steamboat, flourishing, his, arms, frantically, Maria, with, the, restsupposed, he, was, in, jest, or, a, madman, but, now, remembered, he, was, like, herbrother, who, must, have, seen, her, and, motioned, her, to, stop, Maria, hadexpected, a, town, and, did, not, imagine, that, her, stopping, place, As, ourboat, was, so, uncertain, in, its, movements, the, poor, man, must, have, spent, theday, upon, the, shore, and, was, now, doubtless, very, anxious, about, his, youngsister, There, was, nothing, for, her, to, do, now, but, stop, in, the, steamboat, atSt, Louis, until, its, return, trip, I, felt, sorry, for, the, poor, girl, onlyfifteen, and, thus, left, to, the, tender, mercy, of, the, world, We, spoke, to, thecaptain, and, chambermaid, who, both, promised, to, take, charge, of, her, andland, her, at, her, brothers, when, he, returned, next, week, The, afternoon, isbeautiful, we, are, peeping, up, the, forest, glades, as, the, channel, runs, nearthe, shore, or, inhaling, the, rich, perfume, which, the, summer, breeze, shakesout, from, the, trees, Suddenly, the, forest, is, passed, and, we, gaze, over, thelow, prairie, which, lies, between, the, two, rivers, bounded, by, a, line, ofround, green, hills, which, range, across, the, country, ‘, The, bluffs, of, theMississippi, ’, exclaimed, my, companion, ‘, and, we, soon, shall, see, its, famouswaters, ’, We, hastened, up, to, the, hurricane, deck, and, placed, ourselves, in, agood, situation, for, beholding, the, scenery, a, little, excited, at, thethought, of, looking, upon, the, grand, and, celebrated, stream, The, Illinois171flowed, as, straight, and, still, as, a, canal, about, four, hundred, yards, widewe, glided, over, its, waters, and, soon, found, ourselves, in, a, broad, majesticstream, which, came, rolling, down, between, a, range, of, bluffs, here, a, milebroad, upon, whose, bosom, some, lonely, islands, stretched, across, from, themouth, of, the, Illinois, The, view, was, delightful, upon, each, side, the, fairplains, of, Missouri, at, our, right, and, upon, the, Illinois, side, boldbeautiful, cliffs, or, green, cone, like, hills, covered, with, a, soft, carpetof, verdure, sinking, down, upon, the, east, side, into, lovely, green, dellsThis, style, of, hill, is, called, by, the, French, Mamelle, In, one, of, thesepretty, nooks, nestled, at, the, foot, of, a, bluff, is, the, town, of, Graftonfrom, whose, balconies, the, inhabitants, obtain, a, fine, view, up, theMississippi, This, town, is, only, a, few, years, old, but, expects, soon, torival, Alton, as, most, of, the, travelling, from, the, interior, to, the, Missouritowns, opposite, is, through, it, It, has, already, laid, out, upon, paper, arailroad, to, Springfield, the, capitol, The, rapid, tide, of, the, ‘, father, ofwaters, ’, presented, a, great, contrast, to, the, languid, Illinois, The, coloris, brown, but, of, a, different, tint, from, the, Illinois, being, a, dark, coffeebrown, but, clear, and, sparkling, We, looked, a, last, farewell, to, the, fairIllinois, upon, whose, banks, or, on, whose, water, we, had, travelled, for, fourdays, and, four, nights, a, distance, of, nearly, four, hundred, and, fifty, milesif, we, include, the, Des, Plaines, The, loveliness, of, the, scenery, all, thisdistance, merits, the, encomiums, made, upon, it, by, the, early, French, writersThis, was, a, favorite, river, with, the, French, and, La, Salle, Charlevoix, andMarquette, describe, the, beauty, of, its, shores, in, glowing, terms, The, bluffs, upon, the, Illinois, shore, as, we, descend, the172, Mississippibecome, more, bare, and, precipitous, and, have, a, waterworn, appearance, as, ifthe, water, had, once, flowed, along, their, summits, The, regularstratification, of, the, sandstone, and, limestone, of, these, cliffs, presentthe, appearance, of, mason, work, crowning, the, heights, with, castellatedresemblances, so, that, we, might, imagine, we, were, passing, beneath, somemountain, fastness, with, its, frowning, walls, dungeon, keep, and, warder’stower, Occasionally, masses, of, white, limestone, are, strewed, along, theshore, or, grouped, upon, the, green, sloping, bank, as, if, some, large, city, hadthere, arisen, upon, the, river, ’s, side, Turning, a, sharp, angle, of, one, ofthose, bluffs, we, found, ourselves, before, a, large, imposing, looking, townbuilt, upon, the, bank, of, the, river, which, came, sloping, down, from, thebluffs, behind, This, we, learned, was, Alton, While, our, crew, were, mooringour, boat, upon, the, steep, bank, we, gazed, with, great, curiosity, and, interestupon, this, place, larger, than, any, we, had, seen, since, leaving, Detroitfourteen, hundred, miles, behind, To, the, left, the, rocks, were, crowned, by, alarge, solid, looking, building, which, we, were, told, was, the, penitentiary, Infront, was, a, row, of, high, warehouses, made, of, limestone, filled, with, goodsand, men, while, a, mass, of, houses, and, steeples, at, our, right, were, brightlyreflecting, the, rays, of, the, sinking, sun, The, shore, presented, a, busyscene, men, and, carts, and, horses, were, transporting, goods, or, luggage, orbusily, employed, Macadamizing, the, bank, —, a, great, improvement, upon, thewharves, we, had, passed, A, large, brick, building, at, our, right, hand, with, awhite, porch, and, steps, bearing, the, sign, of, ‘, Alton, House, ’, being, ourplace, of, destination, we, directed, our, course, towards, it, The, keeper173, ofthe, house, being, absent, and, it, being, no, one, ’s, business, to, take, care, ofus, we, spent, some, time, wandering, about, the, well, furnished, parlors, andstaring, at, the, waiters, who, were, washing, up, the, tea, things, in, thediningroom, ere, we, could, find, any, one, to, listen, to, our, wants, We, hadleft, behind, us, the, land, where, a, living, is, only, to, be, obtained, by, effortand, where, the, landlord, and, porters, are, on, the, alert, in, order, to, catchthe, stranger, and, take, him, in, Here, the, cool, American, manner, obtainsand, although, to, the, hungry, tired, traveller, rather, annoying, yet, whenwe, reflect, upon, the, peace, and, independence, and, plenty, which, producesthis, indifference, he, will, do, as, we, did, throw, himself, upon, a, sofa, keepcool, and, quietly, await, the, arrival, of, somebody, While, amusing, ourselves, looking, around, at, the, furniture, we, observed, aportrait, of, as, we, afterwards, learned, the, master, of, the, house, As, muchas, we, had, heard, of, the, wild, independence, the, devilmecare, manners, ofour, western, brethren, we, were, here, taken, by, surprise, He, was, without, hiscoat, —, actually, painted, in, his, shirt, sleeves, —, having, upon, his, head, an, oldstraw, hat, It, was, probably, a, warm, day, or, he, was, in, too, much, of, a, hurryto, put, on, his, coat, when, he, went, to, sit, and, besides, it, was, nobody’sbusiness, but, his, own, how, he, was, dressed, or, if, he, were, dressed, at, alland, I, suppose, we, may, be, thankful, he, retained, his, white, robe, ‘, any, way’Luxury, refinement, and, conventual, forms, may, be, carried, to, excess, but, Iam, not, prepared, to, say, the, other, extreme, is, better, A, boarder, in, thehouse, happening, to, stray, in, we, told, our, wants, and, he, kindly, sent, awaiter, for, the, master, of, the, house, He, came, instantly, and, with, thegreatest174, alacrity, and, wish, to, oblige, took, us, up, stairs, All, the, roomsproving, full, or, engaged, except, one, too, small, we, were, directed, toanother, house, which, after, a, short, moonlight, walk, we, reached, TheEagle, tavern, a, favorite, name, for, hotels, I, think, in, our, country, was, acomfortable, house, although, not, pretending, to, the, style, and, fashion, ofthe, Alton, House, And, now, having, finished, these, last, few, lines, while, oursupper, was, preparing, I, hasten, to, bid, you, goodnight175, Alton, July, 11th, My, dear, E, —, Harassed, by, no, compunctious, visitings, for, the, enormouspackage, which, I, dismissed, to, you, this, morning, through, the, Altonpostoffice, I, have, seated, myself, deliberately, before, my, little, desk, toprepare, you, another, We, have, spent, a, delightful, day, among, our, friendshere, and, are, very, much, pleased, with, the, towns, of, Alton, for, there, aretwo, of, them, We, are, now, four, o’clock, waiting, for, the, steamboat, to, takeus, to, St, Louis, and, I, employ, the, time, in, making, a, few, sketches, of, theplace, for, you, Alton, is, built, as, I, told, you, upon, a, sloping, bank, Thisground, is, very, uneven, and, upon, some, of, the, elevated, portions, are, thepublic, buildings, The, churches, here, are, well, built, and, numerous, I, thinkseven, or, eight, the, streets, wide, and, airy, places, reserved, for, publicsquares, and, several, handsome, private, dwellings, The, town, has, arisenrapidly, and, from, a, small, town, in, 1832, it, has, now, fine, streets, andhouses, two, hundred, being, built, last, year, merchants, who, transactbusiness, to176, the, amount, of, several, hundred, thousand, dollars, and, evenhalf, a, million, in, some, instances, Eight, or, ten, steamboats, are, ownedhere, and, two, railroads, in, contemplation, and, the, great, national, road, itis, thought, will, be, conducted, through, this, place, There, are, severalreligious, societies, here, each, having, houses, of, worship, among, them, thebaptist, church, is, spoken, of, as, being, nicely, fitted, up, in, the, interiorit, is, built, of, stone, Every, convenience, and, comfort, of, life, is, at, handcoal, in, profusion, in, the, vicinity, of, the, town, which, is, sold, very, cheaplimestone, freestone, and, water, lime, besides, other, mineral, productionsabound, The, markets, are, stored, with, wild, game, —, deer, partridges, prairiehen, and, waterfowl, fruits, both, wild, and, cultivated, various, sorts, offish, corn, beef, pork, and, vegetables, of, the, finest, order, Madisoncounty, in, which, it, stands, is, one, of, the, richest, in, the, State, beingmost, of, it, upon, the, American, bottom, It, contains, seven, hundred, andninety, square, miles, and, the, value, of, its, productions, exclusive, ofcapital, invested, and, cost, of, buildings, amounts, to, two, millions, threehundred, and, sixtynine, thousand, one, hundred, and, fiftyone, dollars, andeighty, cents, Of, bushels, of, wheat, they, have, raised, one, hundred, andsixtyfive, thousand, five, hundred, and, twenty, Corn, one, million, threehundred, and, four, thousand, three, hundred, and, thirtyfive, bushelsTobacco, eleven, thousand, two, hundred, and, eighty, pounds, Capital, investedin, manufactures, two, hundred, and, ten, thousand, four, hundred, andthirtyfive, dollars, But, I, suppose, you, do, not, care, for, these, details, IfI, should, come, here, again, in, a, few, years, I, expect, to, see, Alton, threetimes, its, size, for, although, it, may, not, rival, St, Louis, as, theinha177bitants, imagine, it, must, be, the, most, considerable, place, after, itwest, of, Cincinnati, The, Illinois, brings, to, it, the, produce, of, thenorthern, lakes, and, States, —, the, Mississippi, waft, to, its, doors, the, exportsof, the, west, and, takes, it, over, to, the, Ohio, and, to, the, gulf, of, Mexicofrom, which, last, it, is, only, four, or, five, days, distant, The, interests, ofreligion, and, education, employ, the, benevolent, inhabitants, to, a, remarkabledegree, and, many, thousands, are, expended, every, year, for, the, furtherance, ofthese, objects, Among, these, are, Shurtliff, College, Alton, TheologicalSeminary, Alton, Female, Seminary, But, enough, of, statistics, you, will, sayand, I, hasten, to, our, own, personal, adventures, We, ordered, a, carriagetoday, to, take, us, to, Upper, Alton, to, visit, our, friends, there, and, werequite, pleased, to, see, as, nice, a, coach, and, pair, of, horses, as, we, could, seein, our, own, Broadway, After, leaving, the, town, we, drove, through, some, richprairie, land, interspersed, with, trees, through, which, we, obtained, fineviews, of, the, swift, rolling, Mississippi, and, across, it, the, verdant, plainsof, Missouri, with, green, swelling, hills, beyond, A, drive, of, two, milesbrought, us, to, Upper, Alton, a, pretty, small, looking, village, with, spiresand, neat, dwellings, peeping, through, the, trees, This, place, is, verypleasantly, situated, upon, an, elevated, plateau, of, ground, about, two, milesfrom, the, lower, town, Families, here, enjoy, great, advantages, in, regard, tothe, education, of, their, children, as, colleges, and, schools, abound, in, itsneighborhood, The, society, of, this, place, is, very, superior, and, itssituation, healthy, We, found, our, friends, in, a, large, picturesque, house, in, the, cottage, stylesurrounded, by, piazzas, whose, pillars, were, wreathed, with, the, clusteringMichigan178, rose, and, shaded, by, the, graceful, cotton, wood, and, pretty, redbud, and, locust, Here, indeed, was, a, western, paradise, upon, the, Mississippibanks, we, found, realized, those, visions, so, many, have, sighed, after, alodge, in, the, vast, wilderness, a, secluded, retreat, from, the, haunts, of, menwhere, the, confusions, and, follies, of, the, world, are, only, remembered, as, atroubled, dream, A, charming, young, family, and, a, well, selected, libraryrender, this, retirement, most, delightful, A, seminary, upon, a, new, plan, hadbeen, lately, erected, near, their, abode, and, with, a, view, of, showing, usevery, thing, of, interest, around, them, our, friends, drove, us, in, theircarriage, through, a, pleasant, road, in, an, oak, forest, to, the, MonticelloFemale, Seminary, The, building, is, of, limestone, of, that, region, fourstories, in, height, It, stands, within, a, lawn, ornamented, with, groups, oftrees, and, a, fine, garden, is, laid, out, in, the, rear, This, extensiveestablishment, was, founded, by, Benjamin, Godfrey, Esq, a, gentleman, ofAlton, who, to, this, benevolent, purpose, devoted, a, large, share, of, hisproperty, While, a, resident, of, the, west, many, examples, had, come, beforehis, eyes, of, the, miseries, arising, from, the, imperfect, education, of, theyoung, women, who, settle, here, The, dearth, of, servants, rendered, itnecessary, for, the, young, wives, around, him, to, superintend, if, not, assistin, household, labor, and, he, saw, how, much, better, it, was, they, should, comeprepared, for, these, duties, and, quite, able, to, perform, them, instead, ofwearing, themselves, out, and, pining, away, over, tasks, which, by, being, newappear, much, more, arduous, than, they, are, in, reality, As, the, evil, lay, in, adefective, system, of, education, this, generous, individual, at, once, saw, howgreat, a, desideratum, an, institution, would, be, uniting, useful, withornamental179, accomplishments, With, a, public, spirit, to, be, much, applaudedMr, Godfrey, erected, this, spacious, building, for, educating, ‘, wives, for, thewest, ’, Eighty, young, ladies, is, the, limited, number, all, to, be, overfourteen, years, of, age, With, the, course, of, scientific, study, usual, infemale, seminaries, the, pupils, are, taught, music, instructed, in, religionand, in, various, household, duties, Among, other, lessons, they, are, taughtto, set, a, table, arrange, their, rooms, even, sweep, and, scrub, them, washstarch, and, iron, all, their, clothes, Some, young, ladies, who, had, been, bredin, idleness, or, who, had, come, from, the, indulgent, homes, of, Alton, orluxurious, mansions, of, St, Louis, where, slaves, await, their, nod, were, veryreluctant, at, first, to, undertake, these, menial, employments, but, theadvantage, which, so, good, a, school, presented, in, its, other, departmentsrendered, their, mothers, deaf, to, their, complaints, They, were, soonhowever, broken, in, and, sing, as, merrily, over, their, wash, tubs, as, theother, pupils, As, gain, is, not, the, object, of, its, generous, founder, theprice, of, admission, is, placed, low, still, there, are, some, whose, means, aretoo, straightened, for, even, this, and, these, are, allowed, to, pay, for, theirinstruction, by, labor, in, the, house, The, eagerness, to, get, admittance, foryoung, persons, is, very, great, and, many, thus, receive, instruction, who, areof, high, respectability, and, are, enabled, to, attend, to, the, youngerbranches, of, the, family, or, even, if, required, teach, others, Some, ofthese, young, persons, are, beneficiaries, of, a, benevolent, society, calledthe, ‘, Ladies, ’, Association, for, Educating, Females, ’, The, object, of, thissociety, is, to, ‘, encourage, and, assist, young, females, to, qualify, themselvesfor, teaching, and, to, aid, in, supporting, teachers, in, those, places180, wherethey, can, not, otherwise, be, sustained, ’, Young, females, of, all, ages, areselected, from, poor, families, and, placed, in, schools, where, they, arewatched, over, by, these, benevolent, ladies, their, tuition, paid, and, toeach, every, year, is, addressed, a, circular, letter, of, advice, with, thedonation, of, an, appropriate, instructive, book, When, prepared, they, areplaced, in, situations, where, they, can, support, themselves, Several, havebecome, missionaries, and, at, this, school, are, two, of, the, Cherokee, tribewho, are, preparing, to, be, teachers, among, their, people, The, great, amount, ofgood, performed, by, these, ladies, entitle, them, to, the, hearty, wishes, of, thebenevolent, and, patriotic, The, Rev, J, Spalding, in, his, address, beforethe, seventh, annual, meeting, at, Jacksonville, says, ‘, Since, itscommencement, it, has, aided, one, hundred, and, fortyseven, young, ladies, intheir, preparation, for, usefulness, and, heaven, thirtyone, of, whom, areprofessed, followers, of, the, Lamb, ’, Now, that, I, have, thoroughly, describedthe, institution, we, will, leave, the, carriage, and, enter, the, house, We, wereshown, into, a, neatly, furnished, parlor, where, we, were, soon, joined, by, theprincipal, of, Monticello, the, Rev, Theron, Baldwin, a, gentleman, of, greatinformation, and, piety, He, kindly, explained, to, us, the, principle, uponwhich, the, seminary, was, conducted, and, then, offered, to, show, us, the, houseEvery, thing, was, arranged, with, the, greatest, order, and, neatness, Thedining, school, and, recitation, rooms, were, large, clean, and, airy, andthe, bed, rooms, commodious, Upon, the, ground, floor, was, a, chapel, fitted, upwith, the, beautiful, black, walnut, of, their, woods, here, divine, service, isperformed, by, the, Rev, Mr, Baldwin, to, the, school, and, people, of, theneighborhood, who, assemble181, there, every, Sunday, You, see, the, Illinoispeople, are, determined, their, people, shall, enjoy, the, blessings, ofeducation, and, when, we, reflect, how, much, the, destiny, of, our, nationdepends, upon, the, next, generation, we, can, not, devote, our, time, or, our, moneyto, a, better, purpose, than, furthering, such, institutions, We, left, theseminary, pleased, with, its, arrangements, and, wishing, all, success, to, thegenerous, individual, who, originated, the, establishment, It, is, delightfulto, see, wealth, so, well, employed, to, behold, the, ‘, just, steward, ’, thus, ablydisposing, of, his, master, ’s, property, Such, disinterestedness, shone, out, inbold, relief, from, the, selfish, and, reckless, waste, of, fortune, which, we, hadbeheld, in, our, pilgrimage, like, one, of, his, own, ‘, oak, islands, ’, upon, asunny, and, treeless, prairie, Once, more, we, experienced, the, pains, of, parting, and, were, forced, to, leaveour, friends, that, afternoon, We, returned, to, our, hotel, where, we, areawaiting, the, arrival, of, our, steamboat, which, is, to, take, us, to, St, LouisWhen, I, look, around, in, this, interesting, country, and, upon, such, towns, asAlton, I, wonder, why, our, Atlantic, cities, are, so, full, of, people, How, manyyoung, men, do, I, know, there, and, indeed, whole, families, who, arestruggling, for, a, living, and, denying, themselves, every, comfort, that, theirspare, income, may, suffice, to, give, them, a, showy, appearance, in, publiccrammed, into, crowded, boarding, houses, narrow, hot, dusty, streets, whenthere, is, here, in, this, wide, beautiful, land, room, fresh, air, finescenery, employment, everything, to, be, enjoyed, at, half, the, expense, theyare, forced, to, lay, out, among, so, many, discomforts, The, steamboat, bellwarns, me, to, put, up, my, note, book, and, I, will, resume, when, aboard182, We, found, ourselves, in, a, small, steamboat, which, makes, regular, tripsbetween, this, town, and, St, Louis, twentyfive, miles, Alton, looked, verypretty, when, we, turned, to, bid, a, sorrowful, adieu, and, we, regretted, ourtime, would, not, allow, us, to, remain, in, this, interesting, place, We, are, nowall, eagerly, looking, out, for, the, giant, Missouri, whose, junction, with, theMississippi, is, but, two, miles, below, Alton, At, length, the, point, is, inview, all, gather, upon, the, guards, and, bend, our, eyes, towards, the, rightshore, —, we, are, now, before, the, mouth, and, behold, an, extraordinary, sceneThe, Missouri, does, not, as, travellers, tell, us, come, rushing, andbounding, and, dashing, along, striking, the, Mississippi, with, such, aconcussion, that, volumes, of, mist, arise, in, the, air, —, we, beheld, nothing, sowonderful, —, a, broad, stream, rolled, down, between, its, verdant, banksrapidly, and, very, like, a, torrent,

the, first, relic, we, have, seen, of, thatbrave, Castilian, race, which, once, reigned, over, these, broad, lands, It, is, Ithink, their, ultima, thula, their, most, northern, point, The, appearanceof, St, Louis, from, the, water, is, very, much, like, Albany, as, it, is, builtupon, rising, ground, consisting, of, two, plateaus, of, land, the, lastelevated, several, feet, above, the, other, but, its, water, craft, gave, it, quitea, different, character, We, are, used, in, our, cities, to, behold, the, waterfront, bristling, with, masts, but, here, we, saw, steamboats, alone, therebeing, about, seventy, moored, at, the, wharves, which, gave, a, novel, andwestern, appearance, to, the, scene184, The, flat, boat, is, fast, disappearingand, steamboats, are, the, only, style, of, boat, with, few, exceptions, whichwe, see, of, these, five, hundred, and, eightyeight, have, been, built, upon, thewestern, waters21, The, city, of, St, Louis, stretches, a, mile, along, theelevated, shore, and, nearly, the, same, distance, back, We, almost, fanciedourselves, in, New, York, again, so, great, was, the, stir, upon, the, wharf, Thewarehouses, of, brick, or, limestone,

cross, currents, in, our, channel, how, refreshing, how, necessary, is, itfor, us, to, anchor, for, a, little, while, and, look, about, and, consider, ourfuture, course, The, Sabbath, is, a, precious, anchor, to, the, soul, giving, ittime, to, meditate, upon, its, future, career, and, consult, those, charts, whicha, kind, heaven, has, sent, to, direct, its, route, The, Sabbath, is, necessary,

than, if, sometimes, relaxed, It, was, theopinion, of, the, great, Wilberforce, that, the, suicide, of, Lord, Londonderryand, that, of, Sir, Samuel, Romilly, was, owing, to, their, neglect, of, this, day, ofrest, Speaking, of, the, death, of, the, former, he, says, ‘, he, was, certainlyderanged, —, the, effect, probably, of, continued, wear, and, tear, of, the, mindBut, the, strong, impression, of, my, mind, is, that, it, is, the, effect, of, thenonobservance, of, the, Sabbath, both, as, abstracting, from, politics, fromthe, continual, recurrence, of, the, same, reflections, and, as, correcting, thefalse, views, of, worldly, things, and, bringing, them, down, to, their, ownindistinctness, He, really, was, the, last, man, in, the, world, who, appearedlikely, to, be, carried, away,

about, to, everything, worth, seeing, in, the, city, In, the, French, part, of, the, town, thestreets, are, narrow, and, present, quite, a, foreign, and, antique, appearanceHere, are, several, neat, whitewashed, steep, roofed, dwellings, surrounded, bypiazzas, and, occupied, by, the, French, part, of, the, community, Main, streetwhich, corresponds, with, our, Pearl, street, runs, parallel, with,

buildings, publicand, private, some, of, these, last, surrounded, by, courts, and, adorned, bytrees, Here, many, eastern, people, dwell, A, gentleman, of, the, place, told, usthere, had, been, nine, hundred, houses, put, up, in, the, city, this, year, andfrom, appearances, I, should, think, this, a, true, estimate, There, is, a, medicalcollege, in, progress, and, a, large, hotel188, nearly, finished, which, is, saidto, be, the, largest, hotel, in, the, States, It, is, of, red, brick, ornamentedwith, white, marble, and, is, altogether, a, handsome, building, It, is, to, becalled, the, ‘, St, Louis, House, ’, Several, institutions, are, conducted, bycatholics, as, the, Convent, of, the, Sacred, Heart, and, the, University, of, StLouis, In, the, library, of, the, latter, are, nearly, seven, thousand, volumesThe, court, house, is, of, brick, with, a, circular, portico, supported, by, whitecolumns, It, stands, in, a, large, court, in, the, centre, of, the, city, surroundedby, an,

in, front, the, swift, rollingMississippi, and, beyond, it, the, rich, fields, of, the, American, bottoms, inIllinois, and, the, white, buildings, of, Illinois, town, opposite, Whileleaving, the, court, house, we, were, attracted, by, some, advertisements, uponthe, door, for, the, sale, of, slaves, We, noticed, one, for, the, sale, of‘Theresa, a, likely, negro, girl, about, twelve, years, of, age, ’, This, was, ourfirst, intimation, we, were, in, a, land, of, slavery, You, must, not, expect, adissertation, upon, slavery, for, whatever, my, opinions, are, I, shall, keepthem, to, myself, as, I, can, not, mend, or, alter, the, state, of, things, by, myadvise, nor, is, it, a, woman, ’s, province, to, meddle, in, such, high, matters, ofState, However, I, might, think, I, certainly, shall, never, speak, in, publicupon, the, subject, as, I, have, a, good, old, friend, called, St, Paul, and, hein, one, of, his, letters, says, ‘, It, is, a, shame, for, a, woman, to, speak, inpublic, ’, and, ‘, women, should, be, keepers, at, home, ’, It, is, true, I, am, not, akeeper, at, home, just, now, but, I, am, travelling, for, health, and, not, toenlighten, the, people, with, my, wisdom, The, num189ber, of, slaves, in, Missouriis, forty, eight, thousand, nine, hundred, and, fortyone, —, its, entirepopulation, is, five, hundred, thousand, We, visited, a, museum, herecelebrated, for, its, collection, of, organic, remains, and, we, were, surprisedat, the, number, and, good, preservation, of, these, ‘, medals, of, creation, ’, Theowner, and, keeper, of, this, museum, is, Mr, Koch, a, man, of, great, enthusiasmupon, the, subject, of, paleantology, He, had, just, returned, from, anexpedition, to, the, interior, of, Missouri, from, whence, he, had, procuredninety, weight, of, bones, Seeing, our, interest, in, these, things, he, admittedus, into, an, interior, room, which, had, the, appearance, of, a, charnel, housefilled, with, bones, and, skeletons, which, his, servant, was, covering, withpreparation, to, preserve, them, from, the, effects, of, the, air, Among, themwere, gigantic, remains, of, the, mastodon, and, other, huge, animals, with, teethin, excellent, preservation, This, museum, contained, many, well, preservedspecimens, the, most, important, of, all, was, a, huge, animal, with, tusks, whichhe, called, missourium, He, found, also, a, head, of, an, unknown, animal, which, iscertainly, the, largest, quadruped, whose, remains, have, been, discoveredhaving, two, horns, each, ten, feet, long, extending, out, horizontally, on, eachside, making, with, the, head, a, length, of, twentyfive, feet, from, the, tip, ofone, tusk, to, that, of, the, other, The, missourium, so, called, from, the, Statein, which, it, was, found, was, an, animal, much, larger, than, the, elephanthaving, tusks, measuring, four, and, a, half, feet, in, length, and, one, and, ahalf, in, circumference, near, the, head, These, animals, with, theantediluvial, reindeer, and, horse, of, a, large, size, and, myriads, of, brokenbones, were, found, by, Mr, Koch, last, May, near, the, sulphur, springs, atLittle190, Rock, creek, twentytwo, miles, south, of, St, Louis, They, were, in, avalley, surrounded, by, high, cliffs, this, great, deposit, of, bones, forming, an‘osseous, brescia, such, as, is, found, upon, the, east, coast, of, theMediterranean, sea, ’, ‘, The, lower, strata, upon, whose, surface, these, boneswere, deposited, ’, says, Mr, Koch, in, his, written, description, which, he, gaveus, ‘, consists, of, a, bluish, sand, resembling, that, which, is, often, found, uponthe, bottom, of, the, Mississippi, ’, These, bones, were, cemented, in, a, layer, ofgravel, one, and, a, half, feet, in, thickness, The, cement, is, calcareous, of, ayellow, grey, color, containing, saltpeter, It, combines, the, bones, andgravel, together, so, that, it, is, with, the, greatest, difficulty, they, can, beseparated, this, layer, is, covered, with, a, crust, of, chrystalization, Thenext, strata, is, composed, of, small, pieces, of, rock, and, bones, broken, andin, some, instances, ground, to, powder, these, rocks, are, limestone, some, ofthem, weighing, several, tons, The, next, strata, is, blue, clay, from, two, tofour, feet, in, thickness, containing, few, bones, this, clay, is, covered, withbroken, rocks, again, above, which, is, the, soil, covered, with, trees, Thewhole, mass, makes, a, hill, sloping, down, from, the, rocky, bluff, of, thirty, orforty, feet, to, the, creek, Mr, Koch, is, of, opinion, these, animals, herdedtogether, and, sought, shelter, under, these, cliffs, during, some, greatconvulsion, of, nature, and, here, met, their, death, by, being, crushed, bycrumbling, rocks, and, covered, with, debris, Here, we, saw, also, the, remainsof, that, animal, which, I, mentioned, in, one, of, my, former, letters, as, havingbeen, killed, by, human, hands, Beneath, it, had, been, built, a, fire, of, woodand, around, it, were, Indian, axes, and, large, pieces, of, stone, which, had, beenthrown, at, it191, as, if, for, the, purpose, of, killing, it, The, animal, hadevidently, been, mired, and, killed, by, the, inhabitants, This, is, a, discoveryof, great, importance, proving, the, mastodon, according, to, Indiantradition, had, lived, since, the, deluge, He, showed, us, the, elephant, fishor, spoonbill, taken, from, a, lake, in, Illinois, which, was, saturated, withoil, although, it, had, been, cleaned, and, dried, several, years, also, somelive, specimens, of, prairie, animals, —, the, wolverine, the, prairie, wolf, andthe, marmot, or, prairie, dog, a, small, grey, animal, famous, for, dwelling, inthe, same, nest, with, the, prairie, owl, You, have, heard, of, this, prairie, dogwhose, villages, extend, over, many, acres, in, the, prairies, they, burrow, underthe, ground, having, over, the, entrance, to, their, hole, a, small, mound, abouttwo, feet, high, and, eighteen, inches, wide, Charles, Lucien, Bonaparte, says, ofthem, ‘, It, is, a, very, odd, circumstance, that, this, owl, and, dog, should, sharethe, same, habitation, but, so, it, is, and, they, present, an, example, of, unitywhich, is, quite, pleasing, ’, Another, striking, feature, in, the, case, of, theseanimals, is, they, make, the, same, cry, cheh, cheh, pronounced, severaltimes, in, rapid, succession, In, the, afternoon, we, strolled, out, to, the, suburbs, of, the, town, to, see, theIndian, mounds, several, of, which, are, grouped, together, near, the, riverbank, in, the, environs, of, the, city, One, of, them, is, enclosed, within, thegrounds, of, General, Ashley, an, ornament, as, rare, as, it, is, beautiful, Uponanother, is, built, the, city, waterworks, Upon, one, about, twenty, feet, higha, truncated, cone, covered, with, soft, grass, we, seated, ourselves, enjoyingthe, silence, and, watching, the, Mississippi, ’s, flood, rolling, below, uswhile, we, mused, upon, the, fate, and, fortunes, of, these, ancient, ‘, moundbuilders, ’, The192, thermometer, had, stood, at, ninetysix, all, day, and, we, wereglad, to, escape, the, heat, and, dust, of, the, city, The, sun, had, disappearedbut, had, left, a, soft, amber, radiance, upon, shore, and, river, and, a, purplehaze, upon, the, tops, of, the, distant, bluffs, of, Illinois, While, gazing, uponthese, monuments, and, looking, at, the, relics, of, a, lost, race, which, theycontain, we, try, in, vain, to, pierce, the, mists, of, time, and, answer, the, ‘, whowere, they, ’, which, we, ask, ourselves, The, vast, valley, between, theAlleghany, mountains, and, the, Rocky, or, Chippewayan, chain, is, studded, withthese, antique, mounds, from, three, feet, to, two, hundred, feet, in, heightThey, are, generally, in, the, form, of, a, parallelogram, except, in, thenorthwest, where, they, take, the, shape, of, a, cone, and, by, a, late, discoveryin, Wisconsin, they, are, seen, taking, the, figure, of, men, and, animals, Thereis, a, human, effigy, which, is, one, hundred, and, twentyfive, feet, long, theothers, are, rude, resemblances, to, the, buffalo, birds, alligator, etcthese, are, all, lying, down, upon, the, surface, of, the, earth, Our, Indiantribes, each, take, the, name, of, an, animal, as, fox, beaver, buffalo, etcwhich, custom, might, have, also, prevailed, with, the, effigy, builders, Thereare, several, grouped, together, here, around, the, one, upon, which, we, aresitting, and, several, upon, the, Illinois, shore, opposite, These, lastconsist, of, small, ones, surrounding, a, larger, one, which, has, acircumference, of, six, hundred, yards, at, the, base, and, is, ninety, feet, inheight, half, way, down, the, side, is, a, step, or, platform, cut, into, the, hillabout, fifteen, feet, wide, It, is, called, Monk, ’s, hill, from, the, circumstanceof, its, having, been, the, residence, of, some, monks, of, La, Trappe, who, duringthe, troubles, of, the, revolution, fled, to, this, country, and, built, a, houseupon, this193, mound, Here, they, kept, a, garden, and, supported, themselvesselling, its, produce, at, St, Louis, and, by, repairing, clocks, and, watchesTheir, penances, were, very, severe, What, an, illustration, of, Shakspeare‘patience, on, a, monument, ’, were, these, old, men, while, meditating, upon, atumulus, in, a, howling, wilderness, In, vain, we, puzzle, our, brain, as, to, thecause, of, these, structures, and, ask, are, they, erected, for, mausoleumswatch, towers, or, temples, Those, which, have, been, opened, contain, humanremains, ancient, pottery, instruments, of, war, and, are, evidently, placesof, sepulchre, Some, of, them, contain, rude, earthen, vases, which, had, beenfilled, with, food, for, the, use, of, the, deceased, In, vases, discovered, in, anIndian, sepulchre, near, Steubenville, upon, the, Mingo, Bottom, were, bonesof, turkies, oppossums, c, which, had, been, placed, there, that, theirfriends, might, not, want, food, upon, their, journey, to, the, land, of, spiritsStone, pipes, are, also, found, cut, out, of, their, sacred, red, clay, of, StPeters, or, steatite, greenstone, and, limestone, some, bearing, resemblancesto, eagle, ’s, or, other, bird, ’s, heads, Arrow, heads, of, flint, or, quartz, arealso, found, with, the, former, article, with, idols, silver, and, copper, ringsand, rosaries, You, have, heard, I, suppose, of, the, circle, of, mounds, aroundwhich, is, built, the, town, of, Circleville, upon, the, Scioto, river, of, OhioHere, was, an, ancient, city, enclosed, by, a, double, wall, of, earth, with, aditch, between, the, walls, The, walls, and, ditch, occupy, nearly, seventy, feetwhich, gives, thirty, feet, as, the, base, of, each, wall, and, ten, for, the, widthof, the, ditch, This, circular, town, or, it, may, be, fortification, was, threehundred, and, fifty, yards, across, A, square, fort, is, near, this, the, walls, ofwhich, were, twenty, feet, wide, without194, any, ditch, The, fort, is, threehundred, yards, across, and, is, an, exact, square, The, present, town, is, laidout, on, these, ancient, and, venerable, works, the, court, house, built, in, theform, of, an, octagon, stands, in, the, centre, of, the, circular, fort, andoccupies, the, spot, once, covered, by, a, large, and, beautiful, mound, but, whichwas, levelled, to, make, room, for, the, building, This, forms, the, nucleusaround, which, runs, a, circular, street, with, a, spacious, common, betweenthe, court, house, and, street, on, this, street, the, principal, taverns, andstores, are, erected, and, most, of, the, business, done, Four, other, streetsrun, out, of, the, circle, like, radii, from, a, centre, On, the, south, side, ofthis, circle, stands, a, conical, hill, crowned, with, an, artificial, mound, astreet, has, lately, been, opened, across, the, mound, and, in, removing, theearth, many, skeletons, were, found, in, good, preservation, A, cranium, of, oneof, them, was, in, my, possession, and, is, a, noble, specimen, of, the, race, whichonce, occupied, these, ancient, walls, It, has, a, high, forehead, large, andbold, features, with, all, the, phrenological, marks, of, daring, and, braveryPoor, fellow, he, died, overwhelmed, by, numbers, as, the, fracture, of, theright, parietal, bone, by, a, battleaxe, and, five, large, stone, arrowssticking, in, and, about, his, bones, still, bear, testimony22, We, must, regret, the, destruction, of, these, mounds, but, in, consideration, ofthose, which, are, allowed, to, remain, undisturbed, and, of, the, taste, andfancy, displayed, by, the, citizens, of, Circleville, in, laying, out, their, townamong, them, we, may, forgive, them, There, is, an, ancient, fortification, nearthe, junction, of, the195, river, Wisconsin, with, the, Mississippi, in, the, anglesof, which, mounds, are, erected, Upon, the, plantation, of, Walter, Irvin, Esqabout, ten, miles, from, Natchez, and, seven, from, the, Mississippi, is, anothervery, singular, group, of, fortifications, and, tumuli, If, you, desire, myopinion, I, should, decidedly, say, they, were, erected, over, the, slain, inbattle, Sometimes, they, contain, but, one, body, perhaps, of, some, greatchieftain, whom, the, enemy, ’s, archers, have, stricken, others, are, erectedover, several, bodies, laid, in, layers, who, as, fast, as, they, have, fallenhave, been, laid, upon, the, mound, the, earth, placed, over, them, to, receiveanother, layer, until, the, tumulus, is, finished, Where, they, are, groupedtogether, and, where, fortifications, remain, the, spot, may, have, been, thefield, of, some, great, battle, whose, slaughtered, ranks, required, many, moundsto, cover, them, We, know, it, was, the, custom, of, eastern, nations, to, erectmounds, over, the, dead, The, army, of, Alexander, erected, over, the, body, ofDemeratus, a, monument, of, earth, eight, cubits, high, and, of, vastcircumference, Semiramis, raised, a, mound, to, the, memory, of, Ninus, We, readof, their, erection, by, the, Babylonians, in, their, trenches, during, siegesWho, were, the, people, that, erected, these, tumuli, is, wrapped, in, mysterywhich, I, shall, not, endeavor, to, penetrate, but, refer, you, to, Delafield’sAntiquities, of, America, who, seems, to, have, discovered, much, in, the, Mexicanrecords, which, throws, light, upon, the, subject, It, is, his, opinion, theywere, Sycthians, who, crossed, to, this, country, over, Behring, ’s, Straits, andthese, people, were, once, the, builders, of, the, tower, of, Babel, and, dweltupon, the, plains, of, Shinar, When, dispersed, by, the, confusion, of, tongues, aportion, of, them, wandered, through, Tar196tary, to, the, ocean, and, therecrossed, and, gradually, passed, down, the, North, American, continent, toMexico, and, Peru, He, deduces, his, evidence, from, 1st, Philology, —, asthreefifths, of, the, American, dialects, resemble, the, language, of, northernAsia, twofifths, the, Coptics, and, others,

say, while, passing, through, theregions, of, the, west, we, are, travelling, over, a, ‘, buried, world, ’, Besidethese, races, the, Spanish, French, English, and, Americans, have, lived, anddied, here, The, city, of, St, Louis, which, is, now, so, filled, with, Americans, that, it, israpidly, assuming, an, American, appearance, was, once, inhabited, by, Frenchalone, The, founder, M, Auguste, Choteau, was, alive, when, La, Fayette, visitedhere, but, very, aged, When, young, enterprising, and, ardent, he, led, theexpedition, which, in, seventeen, hundred, and, sixty, four, ascended, the,

watered, bymagnificent, rivers, abounding, in, metals, coal, and, stone, quarriescovered, by, a, rich, soil, and, blessed, with, a, mild, climate, July, 14th, —, The, morning, being, fine, we, were, advised, to, take, some, of, thefashionable, drives, and, accordingly, sat, out, for, the, Prairie, House, Thecitizens, could, not, choose, a, pleasanter, place, to, enjoy, fresh, air, andverdure, As, we, left, the, city, we, passed, several, handsome, country, seatsand, then, found, ourselves, in, the, prairie, which, is, of, the, species, of, landcalled, ‘, barren, ’, covered, with, dwarf, oak, crab, apple, hazel, bushes, andprairie, plums, The, road, wound, through, copses, and, tufts, of, shrubbery, forthree, miles, when, we, arrived, at, the, Prairie, House, which, is, a, prettybuilding, surrounded, by, shade, trees, and, gardens, After, cooling, ourselveswith, ice, creams, we, reentered, the, carriage, and, drove, three, milesfurther199, to, the, Sulpher, Springs, Leaving, the, coach, at, the, door, of, alarge, house, we, descended, a, deep, dell, shaded, by, weeping, elms, immenseoaks, and, beeches, among, which, ran, a, brook, ‘, that, to, the, sleepy, woods, allnight, singeth, a, quiet, tune, ’, The, water, was, bright, and, sparkling, butvery, nauseous, and, tasted, to, my, companion, like, the, Harrowgate, watersThe, walks, around, this, stream, are, very, pleasant, and, must, be, quiterefreshing, to, the, tired, and, heated, citizen, There, is, much, company, hereduring, the, summer, We, took, another, road, home, and, passed, through, a, fineprairie, the, commencement, of, the, celebrated, Florisante, prairie, whichstretches, from, St, Louis, to, the, Missouri, Although, trees, were, groupedupon, the, plains, we, passed, several, spots, In, returning, we, passed, a, load, of, fine, looking, coal, which, we, were, toldcame, from, Manchester, a, small, town, a, few, miles, distant, At, two, o’clock, we, went, on, board, the, steamboat, Monsoon, in, which, we, wereto, go, to, Cincinnati, Every, minute, we, expected, to, go, but, hour, after, hourpassed, away, and, still, we, did, not, move, To, our, questions, the, captain, gaveseveral, reasons, for, the, delay, which, seemed, very, vexatious, to, him, Weendured, the, day, as, hot, as, it, was, by, amusing, ourselves, with, readingwriting, looking, at, the, opposite, shores, which, we, should, have, visited, bymeans, of, the, steam, ferry, boats, which, were, crossing, continually, toIllinois, town, had, we, not, imagined, we, were, soon, to, depart, —, and, inwatching, the, busy, crowds, upon, the, wharf, among, whom, was, an, old, negrobefore, an, auction200, store, attracting, customers, by, ringing, a, bell, insteadof, using, a, red, flag, as, with, us, —, but, when, night, came, and, we, were, obligedto, pass, it, in, our, hot, narrow, berths, among, mosquetoes, which, no, net, wouldkeep, off, —, listening, to, the, noise, and, profane, converse, of, the, crew, of, theboats, around, and, imbibing, the, perfume, of, a, dock, we, became, very, muchvexed, and, very, impatient, to, be, on, our, way, July, 15th, It, was, ten, o’clock, this, morning, before, we, started, and, thendiscovered, it, was, the, arrival, of, a, large, party, of, St, Louis, fashionableswhich, had, kept, us, stationary, and, who, instead, of, coming, as, expectedchose, to, remain, to, attend, a, party, that, night, We, who, had, been, used, to, the, punctuality, of, our, eastern, cities, wherethe, captain, stands, watch, in, hand, to, give, the, signal, for, moving, at, theappointed, moment, were, extremely, annoyed, at, such, proceedings, but, beforewe, grumble, too, much, it, may, be, as, well, to, look, upon, the, other, side, of, thequestion, The, steamers, upon, these, rivers, make, long, voyages, and, requiremuch, freight, and, passengers, to, pay, their, expenses, From, St, Louis, to, Cincinnati, is, eighthundred, miles, for, which, we, wereto, pay, twelve, dollars, each, and, finding, only, a, few, passengers, engagedthe, captain, waited, for, this, party, hoping, in, the, meanwhile, some, of, theupper, steamboats, would, arrive, and, bring, him, some, more, freight, orpassengers, The, only, thing, we, could, reasonably, complain, of, was, his, badfaith, if, he, had, openly, told, us, the, state, of, the, case, we, should, havequietly, remained, in, our, hotel, awaiting, his, summons, instead, of, placingthe, delay, to, the, broken, machinery, some, hands, missing, provisions201, notarrived, c, off, at,

city, There, areone, hundred, and, sixty, steamboats, plying, between, this, city, and, otherports, The, city, and, its, spires, now, fades, away, and, we, station, ourselvesin, a, favorable, position, for, beholding, this, famous, country, The, Illinoisshore, is, low, covered, with, forest, and, is, the, rich, part, of, the, Statewhich, was, called, by, the, Spaniards, American, bottom, bottom, land, beingthe, alluvion, which, is, found, upon, the, river, shores, between, the, water, andthe, bluffs, and, which, is, usually, overflowed, at, high, water, A, featurepeculiar, to, the, county, is, the, land, nearest, the, river, is, highest, owingto, the, constant, deposit, and, when, the, water, retires, lakes, are, left, alongthe, low, land, which, gradually, dry, away, This,

stratification, asdistinct, as, if, it, was, a, stone, tower, The, cornice, rocks, are, a, ledge, whichruns, along, the, top, of, the, bluffs, for, nearly, ten, miles, These, rocks, aresaid, by, geologists, to, have, been, once, the, barrier, of, a, large, lake, orinland, sea, over, them, poured, another, niagara, which, wearing, throughthem, caused, their, jagged, appearance, When, it,

strata, is, raised, and, theother, depressed, so, that, perpendicular, rocks, do, not, appear, upon, bothsides, of, the, rivers, Whether, this, be, the, cause, of, their, direction, I, knownot, but, that, the, cliffs, occur, upon, but, one, side, of, the, stream, Iobserved, upon, the, Illinois, and, Mississippi, St, Genevieve, which, wepassed, this, afternoon, is, one, of, those, old, French, towns, which, werebuilt, during, the, sway, of, France, over, these, fertile, regions, We, stoppedat, the, landing, where, are, a, few, houses, while, the, village, is, a, shortdistance, up, the, Gabouri, creek, upon, which, it, is, built, We, could, see, thesteep, slate, roofed, French, houses, neatly, whitewashed, the, court, houseand, catholic, church, whose, cross, glittered, in, the, afternoon, sun, Besidethe, river, is, a, fertile, portion, of, land, which, was, allowed, to, the, town, bythe, Spaniards, as, common, land, upon, which, was, raised, the, produce, fortown, consumption, The, town, once, stood204, here, beside, the, Mississippi, butas, the, bank, began, to, crumble, away, they, removed, farther, inland, Aboutthirty, miles, in, the, interior, are, the, celebrated, iron, mountains, formedof, micaceous, iron, ore, The, pilot, knob, is, three, hundred, and, one, feethigh, with, a, base, of, a, mile, in, circumference, The, iron, occurs, here, inmasses, of, several, tons, weight, The, other, hill, is, three, hundred, and, fiftyfeet, high, both, ores, yielding, eighty, per, cent, Near, the, town, is, a, quarryof, fine, white, marble, and, a, deposit, of, dazzling, white, sand, which, is, sentto, Pittsburgh, and, sold, to, the, glass, factories, This, is, one, of, the, portsfrom, which, the, iron, and, lead, is, shipped, Kaskaskia, is, another, French, town, nearly, opposite, this, place, but, beingbuilt, four, miles, up, the, Kaskaskia, river, we, could, only, see, its, landingIt, was, settled, by, La, Salle, in, 1683, and, was, supported,

obstructions, which, couldwith, small, expense, be, cleared, away, Some, of, the, best, land, in, the, Stateis, upon, its, banks, Chester, is, a, small, town, a, few, miles, beyond, it, seated, at, the, foot, of, ahigh, range, of, cliffs, Although, small, in, appearance, it, carries, on, a, brisktrade, its, exports, by, steamboat, being, in, 1836, one, hundred, and, fiftythousand, dollars, Among, other, manufactories, is, one, for, making, castoroil, Near, this, is, fort, Chartres, built, by, the, French, in, 1720, to, defendthemselves205, against, the, Spaniards, It, was, a, fine, specimen, of, the, styleof, Vaubon, and, built, in, the, most, solid, manner, but, now, lies, in, ruinshaving, large, trees, growing, upon, its, prostrate, walls, At, the, mouth, of, Big, Muddy,

ofpleasure, to, the, Sulphur, Springs, of, Virginia, some, travelling, merchantsand, several, persons, visiting, the, towns, upon, the, river, A, state, room, wasobserved, to, be, constantly, closed, and, a, young, man, about, twenty, whooccasionally, came, from, it, squeezed, himself, in, as, if, afraid, hiscompanion, would, be, seen, from, without, The, curiosity, of, the, young, ladieswas, soon, excited, and, by, means, of, the, chambermaid, they, ascertained, itwas, the, young, man, ’s, wife, a, young, girl, apparently, about, fourteen, whowas, thus, carefully, secluded, A, runaway, match, was, immediately, whisperedabout, the, young, people, became, quite, in, a, fever, to, obtain, a, glimpse, ofthe, fair, heroine, It, was, a, long, time, ere, their, wish, was, gratified, asshe, never, left, her, room, taking, even, her, meals, there, Our, mornings, onboard, are, generally, very, social, the, ladies, sitting, with, the, gentlemenof, their, party, upon, the, guards, or, gath210ering, in, groups, with, their, workwhile, the, male, passengers, are, smoking, talking, politics, or, gamblingThe, negro, banjo, and, merry, laugh, or, joke, of, some, son, of, Erin, echoesup, from, the, lower, deck, but, in, the, afternoon, the, siesta, is, the, fashionand, every, one, turns, in, his, berth, to, take, a, nap, I, did, not, follow, thiscustom, as, I, was, unwilling, to, lose, any, of, the, scenery, so, that, I, usuallystole, out, of, my, state, room, like, a, mouse, from, its, hole, and, after, a, longlook, up, and, down, the, river, stole, in, again, the, heat, being, too, great, toallow, of, a, long, stay, Yesterday, afternoon, oppressed, with, thirst, andwith, heat, for, the, thermometer, on, board, stood, at, ninetysix, I, went, intothe, ladies, ’, cabin, in, search, of, water, a, jar, of, which, filled, with, lumpsof, ice, was, placed, upon, a, marble, table, in, one, corner, of, the, cabin, Theladies, were, all, in, their, berths, except, two, who, were, using, every, ‘, meansand, appliance, ’, to, keep, themselves, cool, They, were, each, in, a, rockingchair, kept, in, motion, their, feet, upon, an, ottoman, made, a, table, for, theirbooks, while, a, large, feather, fan, in, one, hand, and, a, lump, of, ice, inanother, were, tolerable, arms, against, the, fire, king, Miss, Martineauexpatiates, upon, the, indifference, of, our, females, to, the, scenery, ofnature, and, I, dare, say, she, would, place, these, two, upon, her, list, of, niladmirari, ladies, but, travellers, are, very, apt, to, look, upon, the, surface, ofthings, these, ladies, and, indeed, almost, all, we, meet, in, steamboats, havebeen, so, often, over, the, scene, that, they, know, it, by, heart, and, need, notbrave, heat, and, storms, to, see, it, as, a, stranger, would, Our, people, are, arestless, body, and, men, women, and, children, are, always, upon, the, move, Asthirsty, as, I, was, I, hesitated, to, drink, the, thick, muddy, water, for, while211standing, in, our, tumblers, a, sediment, is, precipitated, of, half, an, inch, Ohhow, I, longed, for, a, draught, of, cool, spring, water, or, a, lump, of, Rocklandlake, ice, While, drinking, one, of, the, ladies, advanced, for, the, samepurpose, ‘, Dear, me, what, insipid, water, ’, she, said, ‘, it, has, been, standingtoo, long, I, like, it, right, thick, ’, I, looked, at, her, in, surprise, ‘, Do, youprefer, it, muddy, to, clear, ’, I, asked, ‘, Certainly, I, do, ’, she, replied, ‘, Ilike, the, sweet, clayey, taste, and, when, it, settles, it, is, insipid, HereJuno, ’, calling, to, the, black, chambermaid, who, was, busy, ironing, ‘, get, mesome, water, fresh, out, of, the, river, with, the, true, Mississippi, relish’Every, one, ’s, back, is, indeed, fitted, to, his, burden, This, person, had, livedupon, the, banks, of, the, Mississippi, had, drank, its, waters, all, her, daysand, now, it, required, to, be, muddy, ere, it, was, palateable, The, chambermaiddescended, to, the, lower, deck, where, a, gallant, black, beau, drew, a, bucketfrom, the, river, and, after, satisfying, the, lady, she, resumed, her, ironingAgainst, this, practice, of, ironing, in, the, ladies, cabin, I, must, uplift, myvoice, I, suffered, from, this, annoyance, upon, the, Illinois, Mississippi, andOhio, Constantly, there, was, a, woman, washing, upon, the, lower, deck, wherethe, water, thrown, from, the, wheel, falls, upon, the, deck, in, a, prettycascade, and, another, is, ironing, above, All, the, ironing, of, the, boat, andcrew, and, often, of, the, passengers, is, done, in, the, ladies, small, sittingroom, the, steam, and, perfume, of, the, wet, clothes, charcoal, furnace, and, ofthe, ironer, is, extremely, disagreeable, In, one, instance, I, knew, this, to, bethe, case, all, night, the, girls, taking, it, by, turns, and, I, never, travelledone, day, without, this, addition, to, the, heat, and, other, discomforts, of, asteamboat, In, such, long, voyages, it212, may, be, necessary, to, wash, for, thecaptain, and, crew, but, surely, bed, and, table, linen, enough, might, beprovided, to, reach, Cincinnati, where, they, stop, long, enough, to, have, themwashed, If, not, why, may, there, not, be, a, room, in, some, other, part, of, thedeck, The, captain, in, some, instances, reaps, the, profits, as, thechambermaids, are, his, by, hire, or, purchase, and, if, they, charge, all, as, theydid, us, one, dollar, and, fifty, cents, a, dozen, the, profit, must, beconsiderable, It, is, sometimes, as, in, our, case, a, great, convenience, totravellers, but, another, place, should, be, provided, But, to, go, on, with, myafternoon, adventures, I, left, the, cabin, and, walked, out, upon, the, shadyside, of, the, guards, All, was, still, except, the, booming, steampipe, everyone, was, asleep, or, reading, I, leaned, over, the, railing, and, found, the, banjoplayer, and, his, audience, all, in, slumbering, attitudes, or, swinging, intheir, hammocks, and, every, thing, denoted, silence, and, repose, Suddenly, aterrific, and, astounding, bang, clang, and, clatter, as, if, the, boat, had, beencracked, to, atoms, the, wheel, house, was, broken, in, pieces, the, boards, flewover, me, and, a, torrent, of, water, flowing, from, it, nearly, washed, me, fromthe, deck, In, a, moment, every, one, tumbled, out, and, rushed, upon, the, deckexclaiming, ‘, what, ’s, the, matter, ’, ‘, are, we, snagged’—‘has, the, boilerburst’—‘is, it, a, sawyer, ’, The, old, Kentucky, lady, who, had, stepped, outfirst, took, her, pipe, from, her, mouth, and, said, quietly, ‘, It, ’s, only, a, log’‘Oh, only, a, log, ’, ‘, nothing, but, a, log, ’, echoed, from, every, mouth, andreturning, to, their, cabins, they, all, stepped, into, their, berths, again, Ilooked, around, me, in, amazement, ‘, Only, a, log, ’, said, I, to, myself, and, whatis, a, log, The, steamboat, is, broken, and, stops, all, is, confusion, and, crashand, I, am, told, it, is, noth213ing, but, a, log, ‘, Madam, ’, said, I, turning, to, theKentucky, woman, ‘, will, you, have, the, goodness, to, tell, me, what, a, log, is’‘There, they, are, ’, she, said, pointing, with, her, pipe, to, the, riverFloating, along, like, so, many, alligators, were, long, branchless, trunkswhich, had, been, wafted, along, thousands, of, miles, from, the, Rocky, Mountainsperhaps, ‘, But, pardon, me, madam, how, are, these, logs, able, to, create, such, adisturbance, ’, ‘, You, seem, a, stranger, child, ’, she, replied, ‘, as, these, arefloating, along, and, we, are, riding, among, them, what, more, natural, thanthat, they, should, get, in, the, water, wheel, break, it, and, stop, the, boatBut, see, the, carpenters, are, already, at, work, and, I, dare, say, they, willhave, it, repaired, in, the, course, of, two, or, three, hours, ’, So, saying, sheknocked, the, ashes, out, of, her, pipe, took, off, her, cap, and, passed, into, herstate, room, to, sleep, away, the, hours, we, were, doomed, to, pass, under, a, Julysouthern, sun, inactive, The, most, remarkable, event, connected, with, thisaccident, was, the, discovery, of, the, fair, unknown, of, the, closedstateroom, When, the, noise, was, first, heard, the, young, man, rushed, outbearing, a, plump, rosy, young, girl, in, his, arms, who, as, soon, as, he, put, herdown, began, to, tell, the, beads, of, a, long, rosary, which, hung, from, her, neckOne, glance, sufficed, to, tell, him, the, nature, of, the, accident, and, he, lefther, to, walk, towards, the, wheel, house, just, as, the, Kentucky, ladydisappeared, Seeing, the, poor, thing, ’s, agitation, I, turned, towards, her, andendeavored, to, sooth, her, ‘, I, thank, the, Virgin, Mary, it, is, no, worse, ’, shesaid, kissing, her, cross, ‘, but, something, dreadful, will, come, to, punish, mywickedness, Oh, how, could, I, leave, my, dear, mother, Abbess, and, the, sisters’Stopping, sud214denly, she, gazed, around, her, in, affright, for, she, hadunconsciously, said, more, than, she, intended, ‘, Oh, dear, what, am, I, saying’she, exclaimed, ‘, where, is, Edward, why, did, he, leave, me, ’, I, soon, succeededin, soothing, her, and, when, I, related, my, conversation, with, the, old, womanshe, laughed, merrily, at, my, ignorance, Her, young, husband, returned, and, wasso, delighted, to, see, her, cheerful, that, he, immediately, drew, chairs, weall, sat, down, and, were, soon, as, social, as, old, friends, I, was, much, amusedwith, the, surprise, of, my, companion, who, had, come, in, search, of, me, when, hesaw, me, upon, such, familiar, terms, with, this, mysterious, couple, The, littlecreature, seemed, delighted, to, escape, from, her, confined, quarters, andrelished, a, little, chat, so, much, that, she, this, morning, came, to, my, roomand, sat, some, time, with, me, We, passed, this, morning, several, islands, oneof, them, containing, ten, thousand, acres, which, with, the, rocky, shores, ofIllinois, make, the, scenery, very, pleasing, Paducah, upon, the, Kentuckyside, at, the, mouth, of, the, Tennessee, is, a, small, town, seemingly, solidlybuilt, of, brick, but, chiefly, interesting, from, the, romantic, story, attachedto, it, It, takes, its, name, from, an, Indian, heroine, who, was, here, sacrificedin, revenge, by, a, party, of, Pawnees, Fort, Massac, is, a, few, miles, below, itwhich, was, taken, from, the, French, by, an, Indian, stratagem, The, Indiansdressed, in, bear, skins, made, their, appearance, in, the, vicinity, of, thefort, which, enticed, the, Frenchmen, out, for, a, chase, when, another, bandrushed, into, the, fort, and, took, it, All, were, massacred, From, thence, to, themouth, of, the, Cumberland, river, the, shores, seem, uncultivated, as, thesettlements, are, back, from, the, river, but, we, were, compensated, by, aglorious, show, of215, trees, vines, and, foliage, of, every, hue, The, sycamorehere, grows, to, enormous, height, sixty, or, seventy, feet, full, of, branchesthese, great, branches, stretch, up, eighty, feet, higher, and, spread, out, allaround, it, The, white, of, its, trunk, and, limbs, has, a, very, pretty, effectamong, the, green, forests, The, white, maple, is, also, a, beautiful, ornament, tothe, groves, its, leaves, being, a, bright, green, but, every, breeze, stirringamong, them, displays, the, brilliant, white, lining, Its, trunk, is, silveryhue, Upon, the, Kentucky, side, of, the, river, we, have, the, pretty, yellow, locustthe, hackberry, with, its, dark, foliage, the, mulberry, juneberry, with, itsred, fruit, and, leaves, lined, with, silvery, down, and, above, all, the, talland, graceful, cotton, wood, tree, popular, angulati, whose, bright, greenfoliage, is, very, beautiful, in, contrast, The, groves, of, this, tree, are, veryornamental, to, a, landscape, Among, these, trees, upon, both, shores, weobserved, the, brilliant, bignonia, radicans, or, Virginia, creeper, whichmounted, to, the, tops, of, the, highest, trees, and, swinging, down, arrangeditself, in, graceful, festoons, adorned, with, its, pretty, scarlet, trumpetshaped, flowers, The, river, is, more, placid, than, our, last, but, is, not, yetfree, from, the, defilement, of, the, Mississippi, and, takes, a, yellowishtinge, Golconda, we, passed, about, twelve, o’clock, upon, the, Illinois, sidea, small, town, remarkable, for, nothing, but, its, fiery, red, brick, courthouse, with, a, cupola, There, is, a, small, settlement, at, the, mouth, of, theCumberland, river, before, which, was, a, row, of, steamboats, which, were, inwaiting, for, the, rise, of, the, river, to, ascend, to, Nashville, in, Kentuckywhich, lies, upon, this, river, Illinois, as, if, wishing, to, leave, a, goodimpression, upon, us, at, parting, rises, in, masses, of, limestone, presentingevery216, variety, of, scene, overhanging, cliffs, promontory, walls, andcastellated, appearances, being, the, foundation, of, the, State, for, at, thesummit, the, ground, continues, in, a, plain, to, the, lakes, Sometimes, ourcourse, lay, so, near, these, rocks, that, we, could, distinguish, the, flowersspring, from, the, crevices, and, the, chrystal, rills, which, jumped, from, rockto, rock, This, destroyed, the, illusion, of, towers, and, turrets, but, we, werecompensated, by, being, able, to, examine, the, limestone, which, presentedvarious, shades, from, the, yellow, clay, marl, to, the, compact, and, bluelimestone, and, light, solite, A, large, cave, runs, under, these, rocks, themouth, of, which, is, surrounded, by, a, grove, of, graceful, cypresses, whichtree, we, have, observed, occasionally, upon, the, shore, before, and, afterthis, The, mouth, of, the, cave, is, an, arch, about, thirty, feet, high, This, cavehas, in, the, time, of, the, flat, boats, been, a, sort, of, tavern, where, the, crewand, passengers, have, waited, sometimes, for, days, in, a, storm, It, was, oncealso, a, robbers, ’, haunt, Many, persons, anxious, to, descend, to, posterityhave, cut, their, names, upon, the, rock, and, taken, from, the, wildness, andseclusion, of, the, scene, by, large, black, letters, but, I, shall, not, ministerto, their, ambition, by, writing, their, names, Shawnee, town, is, a, place, ofconsiderable, importance, in, the, southern, part, of, Illinois, It, stands, upona, plain, elevated, from, the, river, with, a, back, ground, of, bluffs, andseems, a, considerable, place, The, situation, is, most, beautiful, and, itmakes, a, pretty, picture, from, the, river, A, band, of, Indians, of, the, Shawneetribe, once, lived, upon, this, spot, but, at, the, approach, of, the, white, menretired, to, the, western, plains, beyond, the, Mississippi, At, Shawnee, towncommences, the, great, saliferous, formation, which, ex217tends, through, thevalley, of, the, Ohio, to, its, head, waters, and, spreads, away, upon, each, sidethrough, Ohio, and, Kentucky, and, along, the, Alleghany, mountains, The, strataof, this, formation, consists, of, sandstone, limestone, coal, argillaceousrocks, and, slate, stones, but, the, peculiar, rock, from, which, the, salt, wateris, drawn, is, a, white, calcareous, sand, rock, full, of, cells, and, vacantplaces, once, containing, salt, There, is, also, an, upper, layer, of, white, sandrock, from, which, a, small, quantity, is, produced23, To, procure, this, theboring, is, sometimes, carried, very, deep, several, hundred, feet, as, thestrata, generally, lie, below, tide, water, in, this, valley, and, some, wellsare, sunk, three, hundred, feet, below, the, present, surface, of, the, oceanWhere, they, strike, the, flint, rock, strata, it, is, very, tedious, the, workmennot, being, able, to, bore, more, than, two, or, three, inches, in, twentyfourhours, Carburetted, Hydrogen, gas, rises, in, almost, every, place, where, thesalt, is, found, and, wells, are, often, sunk, from, this, evidence, aloneSometimes, the, gas, comes, up, with, such, violence, as, to, drive, out, the, boringmachine, or, flows, with, the, water, and, again, rushes, up, in, suddenexplosions, at, intervals, of, hours, or, days, springing, up, in, the, air, to, aheight, of, a, hundred, feet, This, gas, easily, takes, fire, Petroleom, is, alsofound, accompanying, the, salt, and, is, used, by, the, inhabitants, for, bruisesor, to, oil, machinery, Filtered, through, charcoal, it, is, burned, in, lampsIn, the, country, upon, the, Muskingum, river, are, several, deposites, of, saltrock, or, Muriatiferous, rock, In, Hockhocking, valley, salt, is, reached, byboring, to, the, depth, of, five, hundred, and, fifty, feet, and218, at, anotherplace, eight, hundred, feet, Here, the, water, is, very, pure, and, strongaveraging, fifteen, per, cent, of, muriate, of, soda, and, runs, in, a, constantstream, of, twelve, thousand, gallons, in, twentyfour, hours, Salt, is, alsofound, in, the, Monongahela, valley, Upon, the, Kiskiminitas, river, fivehundred, thousand, bushels, are, exported, annually, it, is, found, upon, theGuyandot, and, in, the, northeastern, parts, of, Kentucky, but, the, mostextensive, salines, are, upon, the, Kenawa, river, where, the, strata, occupy, anextent, of, twelve, or, fourteen, miles, upon, the, river, Fifty, gallons, ofwater, yield, fifty, pounds, of, salt, of, fine, quality, In, some, places, coarsesalt, and, in, others, fine, table, salt, is, made, This, necessary, article, wasfirst, discovered, by, the, animals, who, seem, to, be, very, fond, of, it, Themastodon, elk, buffalo, and, other, animals, were, in, the, habit, of, resortingfor, it, to, certain, places, which, retain, the, name, of, Lick, as, Buffalo, LickBig, Bone, Lick, etc, At, the, lick, upon, the, Kenawha, the, paths, worn, bythese, animals, are, still, visible, For, many, years, salt, was, brought, to, thewestern, valley, with, great, labor, over, the, Alleghany, mountains, upon, thebacks, of, horses, and, sold, for, two, or, three, dollars, a, pound, Now, it, canbe, procured, at, the, salines, for, half, a, cent, Around, the, salines, arefragments, of, broken, pottery, and, other, Indian, articles, showing, theaborigines, were, in, the, habit, of, digging, for, it, Upon, Salt, creek, nearShawneetown, is, a, very, ancient, salt, work, which, was, once, resorted, to, bythe, Indians, Vessels, of, earthenware, bearing, the, impression, of, a, basketare, found, there, and, one, which, was, evidently, used, for, evaporation, islarge, enough, to, contain, sixteen, gallons, This, great, deposite, of, saltseems, to, be, inexhaustible, for, twentyfour219, years, it, has, beenmanufactured, at, Kenawha, and, in, these, last, years, one, million, of, bushelsa, year, and, the, supply, has, not, diminished, Two, hundred, bushels, are, madea, day, The, process, used, is, to, convert, the, water, by, heat, to, brine, andafterwards, evaporized, Ten, miles, below, Shawneetown, we, pass, the, mouth, of, the, Wabash, theboundary, line, between, Illinois, and, Indiana, a, beautiful, stream, runningsix, hundred, miles, through, Indiana, Upon, the, shores, of, the, Ohio, near, itare, groves, of, the, Pecaun, tree, carya, olivæfornis, It, is, a, beautifulstraight, tree, bearing, a, very, pleasant, nut, Pecaun, according, toSchoolcraft, is, the, Chippeway, word, for, nut, At, sun, down, we, stopped, totake, in, wood, and, to, procure, milk, As, it, was, rather, damp, I, did, not, landbut, was, much, amused, with, the, antics, of, men, and, boys, who, delighted, tohave, space, frolicked, and, jumped, about, the, woods, The, southerners, intheir, thin, pink, and, purple, or, blue, striped, coats, added, to, the, gaiety, ofthe, scene, Our, steward, with, his, tin, kettle, entered, a, small, cottage, orrather, log, cabin, near, and, procured, a, supply, of, fresh, milk, which, wesaw, a, young, country, lass, draw, from, their, cow, she, had, just, driven, homeWhile, our, husbands, strolled, together, my, little, catholic, confided, to, meher, history, after, the, fashion, of, travelling, heroines, you, know, She, wasthe, daughter, of, a, wealthy, planter, in, Kentucky, who, although, of, thepresbyterian, faith, had, sent, his, child, to, a, catholic, nunnery, to, beeducated, She, had, as, is, very, common, in, such, cases, become, a, convert, tothe, catholic, faith, and, when, her, parents, came, to, carry, her, homedeclared, it, her, intention, to, take, the, veil, and, never, leave, her, conventHer, parents, intreaties, and, despair, were, of, no, use, stay, she220, would, anddid, A, convent, however, was, not, to, be, her, destiny, for, she, fell, in, lovewith, a, young, gentleman, brother, of, a, friend, of, her, ’s, at, the, sameconvent, who, often, came, there, to, see, his, sister, The, attachment, beingmutual, they, had, with, the, assistance, of, the, sister, contrived, to, elopeThey, were, now, on, their, way, to, New, York, and, she, was, so, fearful, of, beingrecognized, and, brought, back, that, she, would, not, at, first, leave, herstateroom, ‘, Were, you, not, sorry, to, leave, your, mother, ’, I, asked, her, ‘, Ohdear, yes, she, and, the, sisters, were, always, so, kind, to, me, ’, ‘, I, mean, yourmother, and, your, father, not, the, mother, abbess, ’, ‘, Alas, my, parents, aresuch, sad, heretics, that, I, ought, not, to, love, them, I, shall, never, see, themin, the, next, world, and, it, is, better, to, be, separated, here, ’, I, was, shockedat, her, answer, but, thought, the, parents, were, well, punished, for, theculpable, step, they, had, taken, in, placing, their, child, where, she, was, likelyto, embrace, a, religion, different, from, their, own, I, wish, to, say, nothingagainst, the, catholic, religion, but, if, parents, are, unwilling, theirchildren, should, imbibe, its, tenets, they, certainly, do, wrong, to, place, themwhere, they, are, taught, It, is, a, custom, too, common, in, the, west, and, southand, this, is, not, the, first, instance, I, have, known, of, division, betweenparents, and, children, in, consequence, July, 17th, —, We, are, now, sailing, along, the, coast, of, Indiana, having, bidadieu, to, the, beautiful, State, of, Illinois, after, having, travelled, throughit, and, along, its, coast, over, eight, hundred, miles, This, State, seems, to, beendowed, by, nature, with, every, requisite, for, the, comfort, or, enjoyment, oflife, It, is, three, hundred, and221, eighty, miles, long, and, two, hundred, andtwenty, broad, Upon, three, sides, it, is, bounded, by, the, Mississippi, Ohioand, Wabash, and, upon, the, fourth, by, the, great, lakes, it, is, crossed, bystreams, canals, and, roads, and, thus, is, enabled, to, send, its, produce, inany, direction, The, soil, which, covers, it, is, of, inexhaustible, fertilitycapable, of, producing, the, richest, fruits, grains, and, vegetables, coveredwith, woodland, and, prairie, and, abounding, with, coal, metals, andquarries, It, presents, a, level, plain, inclining, gently, to, theMississippi, consisting, of, thirtyseven, million, nine, hundred, andfiftytwo, thousand, acres24, The, prairie, land, occupies, two, thirds, ofthe, State, the, rest, is, wooded, or, bottom, land, These, prairies, were, oncecovered, with, herds, of, buffalo, wolves, and, panthers, all, now, except, afew, wolves, are, far, away, over, the, Mississippi, These, grassy, pastures, arevaluable, for, cattle, and, the, soil, is, easily, tilled, and, produces, treeswhere, the, fire, is, kept, off, All, sorts, of, grain, neat, cattle, swinehorses, tobacco, cotton, and, sugar, are, raised, with, ease, The, amount, ofthe, productions, of, this, State, according, to, the, tabular, statement, drawnup, by, the, United, States, Marshall, H, Wilton, Esq, is, fiftyone, millionfour, hundred, and, eleven, thousand, six, hundred, and, six, dollars, Take, thisaccount, and, the, number, of, its, population, four, hundred, and, twentythreethousand, nine, hundred, and, thirtyfour, and, then, turn, to, the, state, of, thecountry, only, twenty, years, since, when, it, was, the, home, of, Indian, tribeswith, a, few, white, men, scattered, over, it, and, you, will, obtain, some, idea, ofthe, sudden, increase, of, the, west, The, want, of, timber, and, water, as, pine, is, scarce, in222, Illinois, and, uponthe, prairie, there, is, but, little, of, any, kind, has, prevented, thesettlement, of, the, prairies, It, is, the, opinion, of, all, whom, I, heard, speakupon, the, subject, they, were, the, most, eligible, places, of, settlement, aswater, can, be, procured, at, the, depth, of, fifteen, or, twenty, feet, and, timbereasily, brought, over, the, smooth, plains, in, wagons, while, cutting, downforests, to, clear, the, land, is, toilsome, and, expensive, The, centre, of, theprairies, is, always, higher, than, the, skirts, which, if, it, renders, them, drymakes, them, more, healthy, places, of, residence, than, the, dank, humid, groundof, a, forest, The, tobacco, beef, and, wheat, of, Illinois, are, superior, tothat, of, the, neighboring, States, and, finds, a, ready, sale, in, the, marketthe, latter, weighing, sixtyeight, pounds, to, a, bushel25, Very, good, wineis, made, there, from, the, sweet, grapes, which, abound, in, every, part, of, theState, Coal, is, found, in, abundance, every, where, and, will, be, constantlydiscovered, iron, and, copper, occur, in, some, places, while, the, lead, minesof, this, State, Wisconsin, and, Missouri, yield, more, than, the, whole, ofEurope, including, England, It, is, generally, a, foliated, glitteringsulphuret, found, in, cubical, crystals, yielding, fifty, per, cent, in, logfurnaces, and, sixteen, more, after, further, process, The, masses, occur, inclay, and, veins, in, the, rocks, This, rich, mineral, was, so, near, the, surfacethat, the, Indians, frequently, dug, it, up, and, men, in, want, of, money, were, inthe, habit, of, procuring, it, sure, of, a, ready, sale, at, St, Louis, The, peopleof, Illinois, obtained, their, nickname, of, suckers, from, the, practice, ofgoing, up, the, Mississippi, when, the, spring, opened, for, lead, which, was, theperiod, of, the, annual, voyage, up, the, river, of, the, Succar, fish223Thirtythree, million, lbs, was, produced, in, all, the, lead, region, lastyear, The, scenery, of, the, mineral, region, is, very, beautiful, and, is, wateredby, the, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and, other, rivers, The, interests, ofreligion, and, education, are, not, neglected, the, State, has, laid, aside, inlands, and, money, three, millions, for, the, latter, object, Colleges, arebeing, erected, churches, are, building, and, every, thing, for, the, comfortand, refinement, of, life, is, here, in, progress, So, if, you, have, a, mind, toemigrate, come, to, Illinois, We, have, today, passed, several, villages, uponeach, side, of, the, river, possessing, little, of, interest, to, write, youexcept, Hoarsville, upon, the, Kentucky, shore, where, we, stopped, a, littlewhile, There, is, a, coal, mine, in, its, vicinity, The, Indiana, shore, presentsan, elevated, bank, upon, which, we, continually, saw, farms, and, cottages, butthe, opposite, shore, is, low, and, subject, to, inundation, which, gives, it, alonely, appearance, Both, sides, however, are, adorned, with, beautiful, treesHere, beside, giant, beech, walnut, and, various, oaks, were, the, pretty, redbud, cercis, canadensis, the, Ulmus, Americana, red, maple, sassafrascornus, florida, upon, the, Kentucky, bank, besides, extensive, groves, ofcotton,

Fairy, isles, areoccasionally, passed, covered, with, pretty, shrubs, and, flowers, and, fringedwith, the, soft, bushy, willow, called, here, tow, Indiana, shows, many, prettyvillages, embowered, among, her, trees, or, scattered, along, her, slopingbanks, and, we, have, today, passed, Troy, Evansville, Rockport, RomeFredonia, Manchport, while, the, other224, side, Westport, is, quite, aconspicuous, and, pleasing, town, situated, upon, a, high, bluff, its, housesperched, like, eagles, nests, upon, the, high, points, of, the, cliff, while, thebrick, courthouse, stands, upon, the, bank, beneath, The, river, upon, bothsides, had, for, many, miles, back, presented, a, succession, of, these, bluffswild, and, rugged, but, after, leaving, Rockport, the, rocks, become, more, likeregular, hills, rising, gradually, to, a, high, summit, cone, shaped, coveredwith, lofty, trees, and, a, carpet, of, verdure, We, here, saw, that, singularfeature, of, Ohio, shore, scenery, the, hills, upon, one, shore, faced, with, alevel, plain, upon, the, opposite, shore, Each, shore, presents, a, succession, ofhill, and, valley, the, hills, on, one, side, being, opposed, to, the, valley, ofthe, other, As, if, while, the, river, ran, from, east, to, west, the, stratacrossed, it, N, E, and, S, W, a, rupture, in, these, would, leave, room, for, theriver, This, agrees, with, the, theory, of, our, Alton, friend, that, thelocation, and, course, of, this, river, was, caused, by, a, rupture, in, the, coalmeasures, The, boys, upon, the, Ohio, have, imitated, the, Illinois, ducks, intheir, pastime, of, which, I, wrote, you, when, our, boat, has, passed, they, pushoff, the, shore, into, the, agitated, water, of, our, wake, and, seem, to, take, muchpleasure, in, bobbing, up, and, down, We, sailed, under, cliffs, this, afternoonof, rough, rugged, jagged, limestone, with, precipices, and, romantic, dellsquite, sufficient, to, satisfy, a, whole, boarding, school, of, romantic,

strikes, you, with, a, chill, and, they, who, knowits, fatal, effects, hasten, within, —, reluctantly, I, follow, them, and, bid, yougood, night, July, 18th, —, We, are, now, approaching, the, falls, of, the, Ohio, which, arerapids, caused, by, a, ledge, of, blue, limestone, rocks, which, here, cross, theriver, and, impede, the, navigation, except, in, very, high, water, To, avoidthis, a, canal, is, cut, across, the, bend, of, the, river, two, and, a, half, milesin, length, to, Louisville, This, canal, is, excavated, out, of, the, compactlimestone, and, the, cut, is, in, some, places, ten, feet, deep, There, are, fourlocks, The, amount, of, tolls, received, here, from, eighteen, hundred, andthirtyone, to, eighteen, hundred, and, thirtyseven, was, according, to, JudgeHall, four, hundred, and, seventyfive, thousand, twentyfive, dollars, andfourteen, cents, and, he, gives, a, list, of, four, hundred, and, seventeensteamboats, which, passed, through, the, canal, during, the, year, eighteenhundred, and, thirty, seven, There, is, a, small, place, called, Shipping, Port, at, the, mouth, of, the, canalwhere, we, observed, several, handsome, carriages, in, waiting, for, those, whothus, preferred, it, to, the, slower, operation, of, ascending, twentytwo, feetof, lockage, Here, were, several, steamboats, moored, As, we, entered, thesecond, lock, the, North, Star, a, fine, boat, of, one, hundred, and, fortyeighttons, came, dashing, into, the, lock, we, had, left, and, when, we, had, bothascended, the, Maine, which, we, had, passed, upon, the226, river, yesterdayentered, the, first, lock, so, that, we, had, the, novel, spectacle, of, threelarge, steamboats, filled, with, merchandize, and, passengers, all, at, onetime, rising, and, falling, in, several, locks, The, locks, are, large, enough, forfirst, class, boats, and, the, whole, of, the, canal, is, finished, in, the, mostsolid, and, beautiful, manner, It, is, fifty, feet, wide, at, surface, No, horsesare,

had, left, the, canal, we, beheld, before, us, the, slopingbank, covered, with, houses, manufactories, churches, c, This, wasLouisville, the, capital, of, Kentucky, seated, upon, a, gradually, risingbank, commanding, a, fine, view, of, the, river, and, the, Indiana, shoreopposite, We, landed, and, as, we, had, but, two, hours, to, remain, here, weimmediately, entered, a, coach, and, directed, the, man, to, drive, us, throughall, the, streets, past, every, remarkable, building, and, in, fact, show, us, allthe, lions, My, head, was, out, the, window, a, dozen, times, calling, ‘,

St, Louis, and, we, have, one, hundred, and, thirtytwo, more, to, goto, Cincinnati, If, we, are, to, believe, one, of, their, papers, the, cause, ofeducation, flourishes, as, there, has, been, published, this, year, by, onefirm, one, hundred, and, thirteen, thousand, volumes, of, school, books, theyhaving, in, these, and, other, works, expended, sixteen, thousand, dollars, worthof, paper, Our, driver, stopped, at, the, gate, of, a, public, garden, which, hesaid, was, a, fashionable, resort, We, peeped, in, but, were, more, anxious, tobehold, works, of, art, than, nature, and, soon, reentered, the, carriage, andfinding, our, time, expired, returned, to, the, vessel, Here, we, were, obligedto, wait, some, time, and, in, the, meanwhile, amused, ourselves, in, examiningthe, shore, Corn, Island, with, the, rapids, glittering, in, the, morning, sunwas, upon, one, side, and, upon, the, other, the, town, of, Jeffersonville, issituated, upon, an, elevated, bank, on, the, Indiana, shore, The, buildings, arevery, showy, being, of, red, brick, and, some, of, them, pretty, Steam, ferryboats, are, constantly, passing, between, this, place, and, Louisville, CornIsland, is, said, by, the, Indians, to, have, been, the, last, stand, of, the, lastof, the, mound, build228ers, who, they, say, were, driven, away, from, the, countryby, their, ancestors, I, forgot, to, mention, New, Albany, which, we, passed, afew, miles, beyond, Louisville, It, is, a, considerable, place, doing, muchbusiness, and, having, several, churches, lyceum, schools, and, other, publicinstitutions, The, heat, drove, me, into, the, ladies, ’, cabin, which, beingempty, I, sat, down, to, put, down, a, few, notes, I, had, scarcely, seated, myselfwhen, the, young, catholic, runaway, I, mentioned, before, rushed, in, andthrowing, herself, beside, me, hid, her, head, in, my, lap, exclaiming, ‘, Oh, theyare, here, my, mother, my, father, they, will, separate, me, from, Edwardforever, ’, I, looked, towards, the, door, with, much, anxiety, for, I, had, heardthe, southern, planters, were, a, gouging, raw, head, and, bloody, bones, sort, ofpeople, who, whipped, a, slave, to, death, once, a, week, and, I, feared, for, thefate, of, the, poor, young, wife, My, information, however, had, been, taken, fromforeign, tourists, and, I, found, this, idea, like, many, others, I, had, imbibedfrom, them, was, far, from, truth, Imagine, my, surprise, when, a, pleasantgood, humored, looking, man, entered, the, room, and, seating, himself, in, achair, gave, way, to, a, hearty, fit, of, laughter, His, wife, a, tall, slenderladylike, looking, personage, walked, directly, up, to, her, daughter, andfolded, her, in, her, arms, while, gentle, tears, flowed, over, her, cheeks, Ilooked, at, the, father, in, perplexity, wondering, at, his, extraordinarymerriment, and, at, Edward, who, stood, beside, him, having, I, thought, a, mostunbecoming, smirk, upon, his, countenance, The, lady, looked, up, to, her, husbandreproachfully, but, said, nothing, ‘, My, dear, madam, ’, he, said, at, last, to, me‘I, understand, you, have, taken, a, kind, interest, in, my, little, girl’sconcerns, and, I, owe, it, to, you229, to, explain, the, circumstances, of, the, caseAnxious, to, give, my, daughter, the, best, of, education, I, sent, her, to, aconvent, not, far, from, my, estate, where, there, were, some, very, accomplishedladies, from, Europe, who, could, teach, her, all, I, wished, her, to, know, Butwhen, I, went, to, take, her, home, my, lady, fancied, herself, a, catholic, andrenounced, her, home, and, friends, forever, I, returned, home, in, despair, andwhile, revolving, my, future, proceedings, in, this, disagreeable, affairEdward, the, son, of, a, dear, friend, who, several, years, since, had, removed, toNew, York, came, to, make, us, a, visit, In, telling, him, my, difficulties, Iadded, how, glad, I, should, have, been, had, this, not, occurred, to, give, herand, my, plantation, to, him, ‘, I, will, scale, the, convent, and, carry, her, off’he, said, in, a, jest, The, idea, struck, me, as, a, good, one, I, pressed, it, uponhim, and, you, see, here, they, are, and, have, my, hearty, blessing, ’, The, brideas, her, father, spoke, had, gradually, dried, her, tears, and, raised, her, heada, little, When, she, began, to, understand, the, denouement, she, first, blusheddeeply, with, mortification, then, pouted, and, at, last, burst, suddenly, intoa, merry, laugh, and, ran, like, a, fawn, into, her, father, ’s, outspread, armsexclaiming, ‘, Oh, you, naughty, papa, you, good, for, nothing, papa, ’, The, partysoon, after, departed, and, I, received, kind, expressions, and, adieus, fromall, and, a, few, tears, from, the, bride, All, pressed, us, to, visit, them, andthe, father, said, if, we, would, only, come, to, Big, Bloody, Bone, Buffalo, Lickhe, would, show, us, the, finest, blue, grass, fields, best, corn, and, tobaccoand, heartiest, negroes, in, all, old, Kentuck, And, if, I, wanted, a, nice, younggirl, to, wait, upon, me, I, should, have, the, pick, of, all, his, slaves, I, wasquite, delighted, to, meet, with, such, a, romantic, adventure, for, I, had, beenlooking, out230, for, something, as, you, must, be, very, tired, of, hearing, aboutnothing, but, trees, and, rivers, and, towns, Pray, do, not, think, I, made, thisout, of, my, fertile, brain, I, assure, you, it, is, true, After, leaving, Louisville, the, shores, become, more, cultivated, upon, eachside, than, they, have, been, Extensive, cornfields, in, Indiana, show, theyare, as, great, ‘, corncrackers, ’, as, their, neighbors, The, houses, are, betterbuilt, and, always, of, brick, or, limestone, as, pine, is, scarce, upon, theOhio, The, Kentucky, river, empties, into, the, Ohio, about, sixty, miles, aboveLouisville, it, is, a, beautiful, stream, coming, down, from, the, Cumberlandmountain, running, through, high, limestone, cliffs, and, a, rich, countrycontaining, salt, coal, and, iron, in, abundance, It, is, three, hundred, andtwentyfive, miles, long, and, upon, it, stands, Frankfort, At, its, mouth, is, atown, called, Port, William, a, small, place, Kentucky, shore, now, becomesmore, cultivated, and, its, blue, grass, fields, nod, in, concert, to, the, maize, ofthe, opposite, side, Nothing, could, be, prettier, than, the, Ohio, as, we, sailedalong, its, ‘, amber, tide, ’, this, day, The, yellow, marl, which, occurs, sofrequently, along, its, banks, gives, it, a, yellowish, tinge, The, river, lookedas, if, it, had, been, arranged, by, the, hand, of, a, landscape, gardener, soprettily, combined, was, the, grand, and, beautiful, The, trees, are, so, many, ofthem, cultivated, with, us, in, our, ornamented, grounds, that, it, takes, fromthe, wildness, of, the, scene, Here, we, saw, the, locust, the, horsechestnutthe, willow, tulip, and, column, like, cotton, tree, Among, these, the, Virginiacreeper, grape, and, other, vines, are, clustering, and, swinging, in, thesummer, breeze, Springing, from, spray, to, spray, was, the, mocking, bird, bluebird, and, brilliant, green, and231, red, paroquet, flashing, in, the, midday, sunAmong, these, are, pretty, towns, farms, and, cottages, —, the, whole, having, aback, ground, of, jagged, precipice, or, smooth, swelling, hills, Madison, uponthe, Indiana, shore, is, the, place, where, we, were, to, strike, the, Ohio, if, wehad, journeyed, through, Indiana, as, we, proposed, at, first, A, railroad, leadsfrom, this, town, to, Indianapolis, ninetyfive, miles, and, is, completed, toVernon, twentyfive, miles, From, Indianapolis, to, La, Fayette, is, aMcAdamized, road, and, another, railroad, will, soon, be, completed, from, thelatter, place, to, lake, Michigan, That, would, have, been, our, route, and, weshould, have, seen, some, of, the, best, towns, in, Indiana, Madison, is, a, verypretty, town, and, larger, than, any, we, had, passed, It, is, built, principallyof, brick, and, we, counted, six, churches, and, a, court, house, besides, banksfounderies, factories, mills, and, boat, yards, The, streets, are, wide, andMcAdamized, It, is, situated, upon, a, sloping, bank, of, the, river, whilebehind, it, the, hills, which, rose, up, to, nearly, three, hundred, feet, werecovered, with, farms, dotted, with, sheep, and, cottages, Some, handsomemansions, were, erected, among, the, hills, in, conspicuous, situations, and, musthave, commanded, a, fine, view, of, the, town, beneath, and, the, river, windingaway, through, bluffs, and, forests, in, front, of, them, The, population, isabout, two, thousand, Madison, is, fiftythree, miles, from, Louisville, andtwenty, miles, farther, is, Vevay, settled, by, a, party, of, emigrants, fromSwitzerland, The, river, here, stretches, away, to, the, north, leaving, a, pointwhich, is, the, county, of, Switzerland, bathed, upon, two, sides, by, the, Ohioand, containing, very, fertile, soil, Here, the, transplanted, Swiss, have, madea, new, home, and, it, is, a, very, beauti232ful, one, occupying, themselves, inraising, grapes, Their, vineyards, are, very, flourishing, and, they, make, muchgood, wine, They, cultivate, the, blue, grape, Madiera, grape, and, the, nativecounty, grape, which, makes, good, wine, The, hills, here, no, doubt, oftenresound, with, the, songs, of, their, father, land, from, which, they, are, so, manymiles, distant, As, we, approach, the, State, of, Ohio, we, feel, as, if, we, werereturning, to, a, cultivated, country, for, farms, and, dwellings, of, superiorstyle, denoting, wealth, and, prosperity, occur, frequently, upon, the, shoresOne, of, them, was, quite, elegant, built, of, brick, faced, with, marble, andadorned, with, a, portico, in, front, of, the, same, material, Our, setting, sunis, obscured, by, dark, frowning, clouds, which, threaten, us, with, a, storm, Itcomes, in, whirling, spray, and, wind, which, makes, our, stout, bark, rock, underus, and, the, terrific, thunder, outroars, our, groaning, steampipe, In, thecourse, of, half, an, hour, it, was, over, but, hundreds, of, lofty, trees, had, beenswept, from, the, banks, and, now, were, floating, past, us, in, all, their, leafyhonors, A, sudden, stop, in, our, boat, ’s, speed, sent, us, all, out, to, ascertainthe, cause, I, asked, if, it, were, another, log, but, found, the, engine, had, metwith, some, breakage, which, would, detain, us, a, little, while, The, steamboatwas, laid, by, the, shore, and, took, this, opportunity, to, get, a, supply, ofwood, As, the, evening, was, mild, we, left, the, boat, for, a, stroll, and, to, saywe, had, been, in, Indiana, With, some, little, effort, we, climbed, the, cliffsand, when, there, found, ourselves, in, front, of, a, neat, farm, house, surroundedby, barns, and, orchards, The, passengers, spread, themselves, about, in, everydirection, and, we, were, very, much, provoked, to, see, some, of, them, wantonlypulling, off, the, young, green, apples, and, throwing233, them, to, the, hogs, foramusement, I, do, not, know, what, kind, of, consciences, these, people, had, —, Iwould, as, soon, have, stolen, the, farmer, ’s, pigs, as, his, apples, but, I, knowmen, and, boys, are, always, rather, lax, in, their, morality, towards, appleorchards, Prompted, by, a, Yankee, curiosity, to, see, the, inside, of, an, Indianacottage, I, opened, the, gate, and, after, passing, through, a, small, courtyardadorned, with, flowers, we, entered, the, open, door, and, found, ourselves, in, aneat, apartment, with, comfortable, carpets, chairs, etc, This, room, openedagain, upon, a, long, piazza, at, the, side, of, the, house, ornamented, with, a, rowof, clean, bright, churns, and, milk, pans, The, farmer, and, his, wife, nowentered, followed, by, a, troop, of, children, bearing, pails, loaded, withfoaming, rich, milk, They, were, surprised, to, find, strangers, in, their, houseand, quite, a, crowd, in, front, of, it, Soon, understanding, the, case, theykindly, invited, us, to, be, seated, and, offered, us, a, choice, of, new, milk, orhard, cider, They, had, emigrated, here, from, New, York, State, soon, after, theirmarriage, and, having, hewed, themselves, a, home, in, the, forest, hadgradually, by, industry, and, perseverance, brought, every, thing, around, themto, its, present, flourishing, condition, They, seemed, happy, and, healthyFrom, their, door, there, was, a, lovely, view, of, the, winding, river, and, theplains, of, Kentucky, opposite, When, we, had, descended, to, the, shore, weamused, ourselves, gathering, specimens, of, the, rocks, They, were, a, hard, darkbrown, limestone, and, appeared, a, mass, of, organic, remains, containingencrini, terabratula, and, orthoceratites, We, searched, the, pebbles, alongthe, shore, in, hopes, of, finding, some, of, the, pretty, silecious, specimenswhich, I, had, found, upon, the, Illinois, but, succeeded, however, in, pickingup234, only, some, small, pieces, of, jasper, and, a, few, petrified, shells, At, alittle, distance, a, flat, boat, was, drawn, up, to, the, shore, and, fastened, to, atree, one, of, those, long, odd, looking, species, of, water, craft, which, oncewas, the, only, kind, seen, upon, these, rivers, A, man, came, from, it, and, as, hereached, us, bade, us, politely, good, evening, and, asked, what, we, weresearching, for, Some, persons, would, have, found, his, conduct, very, improperand, his, question, impertinent, but, I, never, mistake, the, frank, kindindependent, manner, of, my, countrymen, for, impertinence, We, returned, hissalute, and, informed, him, of, the, object, of, our, search, ‘, You, ’ll, findnothing, here, so, pretty, as, is, on, the, Mississippi, and, lake, Superior, I’vebeen, pretty, much, over, them, regions, and, found, some, rale, beauties, —, theyare, called, cornelions, and, red, a’most, as, them, what, ’s, used, as, watchseals, I, found, some, geodes, I, think, they, call, ’em, also, ’, I, said, I, hadheard, of, those, and, hoped, some, might, have, been, washed, down, upon, theseshores, ‘, My, wife, ’s, got, some, in, the, boat, which, she, ’ll, show, you, ma’am, ifyou, walk, there, ’, I, looked, up, at, the, boat, from, whose, windows, severalfemale, heads, were, taking, observations, and, concluded, to, go, there, Wefollowed, our, new, acquaintance, into, his, ark, which, I, found, was, his, houseand, shop, he, being, a, floating, pedlar, and, had, anchored, or, rather, tiedhis, ark, to, the, rocks, here, to, avoid, the, storm, His, boat, was, not, thecommon, flat, boat, but, was, of, the, species, called, keel, boats, andoccasionally, carried, a, sail, In, addition, to, his, sail, he, used, oars, andpoles, to, propel, it, with, It, was, a, rudely, built, affair, just, high, enoughwithin, for,

would, have, pressed, them, upon, me, ifI, would, have, taken, them, After, we, had, returned, to, our, boat, we, lookedtowards, the, shore, and, beheld, the, crew, assembled, for, a, jumping, matchThey, were, a, motly, assemblage, of, firemen, covered, with, soot, pilotsstewards, etc, They, formed, a, line, —, one, of, them, placing, himself, in, thecentre, holding, a, stone, in, each, hand, swayed, himself, backward, andforward, and, then, sprang, some, jumping, eighteen, twenty, and, twentytwofeet, with, the, greatest, ease, While, crew, and, passengers, were, thusamusing, themselves, we, were, aroused, by, the, cry, of, ‘, The, Ione, is, comingaway, boys, away, ’, and, bounding, over, the, shore, they, were, soon, in, theboat, We, understood, the, meaning, of, this, sudden, cry, and, were, much, amusedwith, the, amazement, and, terror, depicted, in, the, countenances, of, those, whodid, not, ‘, What, is, coming, ’, they, cried, ‘, Bears, wolves, sawyers, what’It, was, soon, all, explained, the, Ione, was, in, view, which, we, had, leftbehind, us, and, it, was, feared, it, would, arrive, at, Cincinnati, before, usThe, hands, were, working, with, all, their,

called, the, Henri, House, Soon, afterbreakfast, we, ordered, a, carriage, which, we, found, to, be, quite, as, handsomeas, any, we, have, in, our, city, We, spent, the, morning, slowly, driving, up, anddown, each, street, along, the, Miami, canal, and, in, the, environs, of, the, cityin, every, direction, and, were, quite, astonished, —, not, because, we, had, neverseen, larger, and, finer, cities, but, that, this, should, have, arisen, in, what240was, so, lately, a, wilderness, Its, date, you, know, is, only, thirty, yearsback, The, rows, of, stores, and, warehouses, the, extensive, and, ornamentedprivate, dwellings, the, thirty, churches, many, of, them, very, handsome, andother, public, buildings, excited, our, surprise, Main, street, is, theprincipal, business, mart, While, in, the, centre, of, this, street, we, mark, itfor, a, mile, ascending, the, slope, upon, which, the, town, is, built, and, infront, it, seems, interminable, for, the, river, being, low, we, do, not,

or, ladies, of, the, family, We, visited, a, museum, in, hopes, of, seeing, some, Indian, relics, or, organicremains, but, found, these, curiosities, had, met, with, the, fate, of, all, thingsin, America, destruction, by, fire, The, owner, of, the, museum, had, beennineteen, years, collecting, it, and, it, contained, among, other, thingsbones, of, mastodon, and, mummies, taken, from, a, cave,

unfortunate, dillitante, as, the, loss, of, a, museum, which, one, has, beencollecting243, twenty, years, is, a, serious, evil, I, think, it, behooves, thecitizens, of, Cincinnati, to, encourage, her, endeavors, to, gather, a, newcollection, by, patronizing, her, museum, From, the, upper, balcony, is, a, verybeautiful, view, of, the, opposite, shores, of, Kentucky, The, two, towns, ofCovington,

looked, down, upon, the, wharf, which, was, a, scene, of, mixedgaiety, and, business, A, row, of, steamboats, lay, along, the, shore, from, andto, which, flowed, a, constant, current, of, men, and, goods, From, some, of, thelargest, the, music, of, the, band, which, they, always, carry, sounded, merrilywhile, broad, bright, flags, floated, out, upon, the, summer, breeze, Reentering, our,

founderies, waterworks, lumber, yards, c, Omnibuses, are, constantly, passing, and, repassingalong, this, street, We, observed, here, several, large, steamboats, upon, thestocks, some, of, which, were, copper, bottomed, as, a, guard, against, snagsFulton, looks, pretty, at, a, distance, seated, at, the, foot, of, a, round, softgreen, hill, After, tea, we, passed, through, the, city, to, the, river, alongwhose, bank, is, a, very, pretty, road, This, is, the, fashionable, eveningdrive, and, we, passed, several, carriages, containing, ladies, and, childrenand, young, persons, on, horseback244, enjoying, the, bland, evening, airAlthough, the, heat, had, been, excessive, during, the, day, it, was, nowperfectly, cool, which, is, usually, the, case, here, Kentucky, looked,

such, as, would, please, every, lover, of, Jesus, and, of, goodorder, One, fact, speaks, for, itself, there, are, here, thirty, churches, Thereare, also, twelve, public, schools, and, between, two, and, three, thousandscholars, who, are, there, educated, What, a, blessed, thing, is, it, to, see, acity, instead, of, lavishing, its, surplus, wealth, upon, theatres, and, placesof, dissipation, erecting, schools, and, such, respectable, nay, eleganthouses, of, public, worship, as, we, see, in, Cincinnati, The, consequences, areseen, in, the, circumstances, and, behaviour, of, the, people,

region246, which, so, lately, resounded, withsavage, merriment, or, war, cries, now, echoing, the, truth, as, it, is, in, Jesus, July, 21st, —, We, arose, early, and, walked, out, to, see, the, markets, Thereare, three, well, built, The, one, on, Broadway, was, filled, with, a, profusionof, meats, fruits, and, vegetables, which, last, were, uncommonly, fine, Thestreets, around, the, market, were, blocked, up, with, wagons, loaded, withcountry, produce, During, our, rambles, through, the, streets, I, was, struck, bythe, sight, of, a, building, the, oddest, I, ever, beheld, It, was, a, huge, uglything, being, a, strange, mixture, of, styles, and, an, attempt, at, GothicTurkish, and, Moorish, This, was, Mrs, Trollop, ’s, erection, built, for, ahouse, of, pleasure, and, rooms, were, constructed, for, balls, refreshmentand, dressing, rooms, while, below, were, to, be, shops, These, balls, were, to, bein, the, style, of, Almacks, quite, exclusive, It, is, now, a, ‘,

Cincinnati, which, appears, Queen, like, indeed, while, majesticallyreposing, upon, her, throne, of, stately, hills, with, the, glorious, river, ather, feet, Cincinnati, is, built, upon, two, plains, which, rise, in, gentleslopes, from, the, river, Fifty, years, ago, fort, Washington, stood, here, andnow, there, is, a, large, city, of, fortyfive, thousand, inhabitants, containingchurches, lyceums,

pretty, villas, and, towns, having, a, background, of, those, peculiar, green, hills, which, occur, upon, this, river, calledthe, Ohio, hills, Among, the, towns, we, passed, were, New, Richmond, twentyonemiles, from, Cincinnati, Moscow, Mechanicsville, Augusta, c, c, Maysvilleis, quite, a, large, town, in, Kentucky, which, looked, very, gay, as, the, sunsetting, over, the, shadowy, hills, lighted, up, its, scarlet, brick, houses, andgave, a, brighter, tint, to, the, cotton, wood, groves, with, which, they, weresurrounded, July, 21st, —, When, we, left, our, stateroom, we, found248, ourselves, nearPortsmouth, the, largest, town, we, had, seen, since, leaving, Cincinnati, It, isseated, upon, a, platform, elevated, above, the, river, at, the, foot, of, a, groupof, pretty, ‘, Ohio,

great, plain, which, inclines, to, the, Mississippithrough, which, the, rivers, have, cut, their, way, into, their, deep, beds, Thegeology, of, these, States, is, very, much, the, same, they, being, based, uponthat, great, secondary, limestone, formation, which, reaches, from, the, easternStates, to, the, Chippewayan, mountains, and, from, the, great, lakes, to, thealluvion, of, the, southern, States, This, is, doubtless, the, deposite, of, theprimitive, ocean, as, it, occurs, ‘, in, layers, of, chrystaline, and, sedimentaryor, in, broken, pieces, cemented, together’26, It, is, of, all, shades, fromthe, dark, brown, ferruginous, to, the, light, grey, the, blue, fœtid, theyellow, silecious, and, magnesian, the, argillaceous, earthy, chrystalineoolitic, etc, In, this, limestone, formation, is, a, variety, of, fossil, shellsof, many, species, as, the, ammonites, spiriferi, encrini, producticorallines, gryphea, madrepores, and, various, others, Its, thickness, isenormous, for, it, has, been, penetrated, one, thousand, feet, without, reachingthe, primitive, rocks27, Above, this, is, the, sandstone, and, slate, andclay, of, the, coal, measures, and, muriatiferous, rocks, These, sandstones, aregenerally, white, ash, color, or, brown, a, very, little, red, has, beendiscovered, in, this, valley, One, of, our, western, friends, who, has, wellstudied, the, geology, of,

by, a, very, agreeableparty, who, had, left, the, boat, with, us, the, remainder, of, our, passengersgoing, on, to, Pittsburg, about, ninety, miles, farther, We, had, been, throughso, many, new, towns, that, this, looked, quite, antique, it, being, settled, inseventeen, hundred, and, seventy, by, Col, Zane, and, his, brothers, whoafterwards, founded, Zanesville, The, streets, here, run, along, the, face, ofthe, hill, and, contain, many, shops, manufactories, a, large, courthousehotels, banks, and, dwellings, Among, the, buildings, are, seven, churches, anacademy, iron, and, brass, foun263deries, flint, glass, works, paper, and, sawmills, steam, engine, and, machinery, works, nail, factory, cordage, wirefloorcloth, factories, c, Eight, stages, arrive, and, depart, each, daySundays, excepted, and, various, steamboats, stop, here, —, so, if, you, know, ofany, mechanics, or, tradespeople, complaining, of, want, of, work, in, yourcrowded, city, tell, them, to, wend, their, way, hitherward, All, kind, oflaborers, will, find, business, enough, in, the, west, I, think, a, society, forexporting, over, the, Alleghanies, the, poor, European, emigrants, who, aresuffering, in, our, large, cities, would, be, of, great, service, to, them, and, tous, The, population, we, were, told, nearly, numbered, ten, thousand, Among, thehouses, we, observed, one, quite, large, and, handsome, this, we, were, told, wasbuilt, by, Col, Zane, when, the, town, was, first, settled, and, his, descendantshave, resided, there, since, He, was, an, active, pioneer, of, the, wildernessand, encountered, many, difficulties, and, fought, many, battles, with, theIndians, ere, he, was, permanently, settled, in, his, beautiful, abode, In, theseattacks, the, females, of, Wheeling, showed, much, heroism, and, took, an, activepart, in, the, affray, The, little, settlement, was, once, attacked, by, threehundred, and, eighty, Indians, when, Col, Zane, had, with, him, but, thirtythreemen, but, the, women, shouldered, their, rifles, joined, in, the, battle, and, didmuch, execution, Once, in, despair, the, garrison, inclined, to, a, surrenderbut, a, young, girl, named, Betsey, Wheat, answered, them, in, such, an, eloquentand, indignant, burst, of, irony, that, they, rallied, and, defeated, the, enemyIn, a, second, attack, Elizabeth, the, sister, of, Col, Zane, saved, the, fort, bybringing, into, it, a, quantity, of, powder, braving, but, passing, unhurtthrough, the, whizzing, balls, directed, against, her, by, the, Indians264, Some, ofthe, buildings, here, are, of, the, light, sandstone, of, the, country, July, 24th, —, We, were, aroused, early, by, the, trampling, of, steeds, and, uponlooking, out, beheld, several, fine, stages, each, having, four, horses, whichwere, soon, to, start, upon, their, different, roads, Our, breakfast, over, wewith, the, party, mentioned, above, entered, a, large, convenient, coach, and, justas, the, clock, struck, seven, left, the, hotel, Upon, reaching, the, top, of, thehill, above, the, town, we, looked, down, upon, as, fair, a, scene, as, any, we, hadseen, in, our, travels, The, town, was, strewed, over, the, hill, below, us, whilethe, beautiful, Ohio, lay, like, a, circlet, of, silver, around, a, pretty, islandcovered, with, waving, corn, and, dotted, with, farmhouses, and, then, glidedaway, in, its, course, winding, among, the, soft, green, hills, until, itdisappeared, behind, one, of, them, The, island, is, Zane, ’s, island, containingthree, hundred, and, fifty, acres, We, had, now, looked, our, last, upon, thelovely, valley, of, the, Ohio, and, its, beautiful, river, the, Belle, riviere, ofthe, French, and, Ohio, Peekhanne, of, the, Indian, This, valley, is, from, thesources, of, the, Ohio, to, the, Mississippi, eleven, hundred, miles, in, lengthand, nearly, three, hundred, miles, in, breadth, It, sweeps, down, from, theAlleghanies, at, an, elevation, of, two, thousand, two, hundred, and, thirty, feetto, the, Ohio, and, then, ascends, gently, four, hundred, feet, to, the, ridge, whichdivides, its, waters, from, those, which, flow, into, the, gulf, of, St, Lawrencea, distance, of, nearly, three, hundred, miles, Through, this, valley, winds, ingraceful, bends, the, noble, Ohio, eleven, hundred, miles, from, its, source, andnine, hundred, and, fortyeight, from, its, junction, with, the265, Monongohela, atPittsburg, It, divides, the, valley, in, two, unequal, portions, having, onehundred, and, sixteen, thousand, square, miles, upon, the, southeast, side, andeighty, thousand, upon, the, northwest, This, valley, enjoys, a, pleasanttemperature, not, too, cold, to, paralyze, exertion, and, not, so, warm, as, toenervate, Its, soil, is, capable, of, yielding, fruits, vegetables, andgrains, of, the, finest, quality, and, in, great, profusion, and, mineralproducts, of, the, utmost, importance, to, man, and, it, is, settled, by, a, freevirtuous, and, enlightened, people, add, to, this, the, scenery, is, beautifuland, varied, and, I, think, you, will, look, far, to, find, a, region, of, countryuniting, so, many, advantages, The, dark, clouds, of, slavery, which, shadow, itsborders, is, the, only, spot, in, its, fair, horizon, The, valley, of, the, Ohio, isin, the, centre, of, a, great, plain, which, as, the, Appalachian, chain, waselevated, raised, up, that, portion, and, consequently, the, rivers, which, flowover, that, division, come, with, more, impetuosity, and, dig, for, themselvesdeep, trenches, in, the, earth, Many, who, have, carefully, examined, this, regionare, of, opinion, the, regular, hills, which, border, the, Ohio, and, many, of, itstributaries, are, parts, of, the, primitive, plain, which, the, streams, haveworn, down, into, their, present, shapes, In, this, valley, lies, that, great, coalbasin, which, is, so, ably, described, by, Dr, Hildreth, in, the, American, Journalof, Science, It, extends, over, four, or, five, degrees, of, latitude, and, asmany, of, longitude, A, circle, drawn, from, the, head, waters, of, the, Muskingumto, the, sources, of, the, Alleghany, and, from, thence, to, those, of, theMonongohela, and, Kenawha, would, mark, the, extent, of, this, depositcomprising, portions, of, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, and, Kentucky, Adieu, to, the, fair, Ohio, It, has, carried, us, for, nearly266, nine, hundred, milesin, safety, upon, its, bosom, unharmed, by, snag, or, sawyer, and, I, say, withMilton, Our, day, ’s, journey, was, very, delightful, The, country, is, rolling, andalternately, pretty, hill, and, dale, scenery, and, winding, rivulets, Thefirst, part, of, our, ride, was, through, Virginia, but, in, a, short, time, at, thevillage, of, Alexandria, we, entered, Pennsylvania, We, drove, over, thenational, road, which, runs, from, Cumberland, in, Maryland, and, passesthrough, the, intervening, States, to, Vandalia, Illinois, from, whence, it, isexpected, to, be, finished, to, Alton, This, is, a, firm, McAdamized, road, eightyfeet, broad, carried, over, mountains, vallies, and, rivers, crossing, thelatter, as, well, as, every, ravine, and, depression, by, well, built, stonebridges, This, very, useful, and, well, executed, work, was, done, by, governmentat, the, suggestion, of, our, statesman, Henry, Clay, We, passed, a, neat, farmhouse, before, which, stood, a, bronze, statue, of, Clay, placed, there, by, awidow, lady, owner, of, the, place, in, gratitude, for, the, benefit, this, roadhad, produced, to, her, property, We, of, course, were, in, duty, bound, to, admirethe, statue, while, rolling, so, rapidly, and, smoothly, over, this, excellentroad, At, Washington, Pa, we, dined, a, pretty, town, having, threechurches, hotels, and, shops, with, a, college, a, large, building, in, thecentre, of, pleasant, grounds, A, large, courthouse, of, brick, was, inprogress, The267, dinner, was, good, but, plain, The, hills, which, we, passed, inthe, afternoon, were, covered, with, rich, pasture, land, where, sheep, andcattle, were, making, a, fine, feast, These, grassy, hills, are, famous, for, the‘glade, butter, ’, which, is, celebrated, around, the, country, and, which, wefound, very, sweet, and, fresh, While, descending, the, side, of, one, of, thesehills, we, were, told, Brownsville, Pa, was, in, sight, and, looking, down, webeheld, a, town, in, the, valley, with, the, pretty, Monongohela, glistening, inthe, bright, sun, as, it, wound, its, way, around, the, hills, Rattling, over, afine, strong, covered, bridge, we, stopped, to, change, horses, before, theprincipal, hotel, This, is, a, large, manufacturing, town, containing, fivethousand, inhabitants, Steamboats, are, here, built, and, completely, fittedup, and, when, the, river, is, high, they, run, to, Pittsburg, sixty, milesdistant, The, hills, are, high, around, abounding, in, bituminous, coal, andlaid, with, strata, of, limestone, and, sandstone, The, coal, here, is, very, richDark, heavy, masses, after, we, had, left, this, place, began, to, appear, in, thehorizon, and, we, were, rejoiced, to, hear, they, were, the, celebrated, Alleghanymountains, We, took, tea, at, Uniontown, Pa, at, the, foot, of, the, chesnutridge, and, soon, after, began, to, ascend, the, mountain, Our, mountain, ridewas, delightful, and, when, near, the, summit, we, all, descended, from, the, stagecoach, to, enjoy, the, views, What, a, glorious, thing, to, stand, upon, the, topof, a, mountain, How, exultingly, you, gaze, upon, the, world, below, You, feel, soproud, of, the, great, feat, you, have, performed, you, breathe, freer, theheavens, seem, nearer, and, brighter, and, the, earth, —, but, do, not, let, me, speakagainst, the, earth, for, never, had, it, looked, more, enchanting, than, whenlooking, upon268, it, from, the, summit, of, the, Alleghanies, The, fair, fields, ofPennsylvania, were, spread, out, below, varied, with, herbage, of, every, shadewith, groves, and, villages, and, streams, whose, waters, were, tinted, withrose, from, the, setting, sun, around, in, every, direction, was, a, green, oceanof, hill, tops, robed, in, a, vesture, of, purple, haze, You, will, smile, at, myheroics, upon, the, summit, of, so, small, a, mountain, as, one, of, theAlleghanies, scarcely, three, thousand, feet, above, the, earth, and, think, itbetter, applied, to, the, Chimborazo, Popocatapetl, or, even, Rocky, Mountainsbut, fortunately, I, have, never, been, upon, higher, ground, and, enjoy, theview, from, the, Appalachian, range, as, much, as, if, I, stood, upon, the, Nevadosof, our, southern, continent, twentyfive, thousand, feet, above, the, seaDepend, upon, it, those, who, have, seen, every, thing, who, have, been, roweddown, the, Nile, climbed, the, rocks, of, Petra, worshipped, at, Jerusalemtoiled, up, the, Himalayas, and, frozen, in, Siberia, are, no, happier, than, wewho, have, been, creeping, about, the, circle, of, our, home, To, everything, youcall, upon, them, to, admire, they, answer, ‘, J’ai, vu, ’, they, have, seeneverything, If, you, praise, a, song, they, turn, away, with, scorn, and, speak, ofthe, opera, at, Naples, if, you, ask, them, to, visit, our, springs, or, our, citiesthey, talk, of, the, spa, ’s, of, Europe, of, Paris, of, London, and, PetersburghThey, have, nothing, to, do, but, fold, their, hands, grumble, at, the, presentand, live, upon, the, past, I, have, not, seen, and, therefore, may, be, allowed, toexpatiate, upon, the, beauties, of, the, Alleghanies, All, that, night, we, droveup, the, hills, and, down, the, hills, shut, up, in, the, stage, coach, We, wereglad, of, our, cloaks, for, it, was, very, cold, and, at, every, stopping, place, wefound, fires269, although, at, the, foot, of, the, mountains, the, thermometerstood, at, eighty, We, talked, merrily, at, first, and, kept, up, each, othersspirits, but, towards, midnight, we, grew, cold, and, weary, and, one, afteranother, sank, into, silence, There, was, much, nodding, and, dozing, but, littlesleeping, for, as, soon, as, one, fell, into, a, doze, another, was, sure, to, askyou, if, you, could, sleep, or, how, you, came, on, a, question, sure, to, put, toflight, your, endeavors, At, last, hopeless, of, sleep, we, gave, it, up, bymutual, consent, and, tried, to, amuse, each, other, by, stories, One, of, ourparty, was, a, western, merchant, who, had, frequently, travelled, over, thesemountains, and, met, with, numerous, adventures, He, told, us, of, an, adventurewhich, befel, him, twenty, years, since, when, the, mountains, were, littletravelled, and, only, accessible, on, horseback, He, was, carrying, a, large, sumof, money, in, his, saddlebags, which, he, feared, had, been, discovered, by, twoill, looking, men, whom, he, had, seen, in, the, tavern, where, he, had, stopped, justat, dusk, He, for, some, time, felt, a, little, fear, but, the, night, had, nearlyworn, away, and, he, had, not, seen, any, one, when, soon, after, midnight, as, hewas, pacing, slowly, along, he, fancied, he, caught, a, glimpse, of, a, manstanding, by, the, road, side, just, before, him, He, gazed, intently, through, thedarkness, and, saw, distinctly, two, men, who, drew, farther, out, of, themoonlight, into, the, shade, of, the, trees, as, he, approached, He, knew, not, whatto, do, he, was, not, armed, no, house, was, near, and, if, he, left, the, road, hemust, be, lost, in, the, pathless, woods, Go, on, he, must, and, he, determined, toput, spurs, to, his, horse, and, dart, past, them, He, gazed, forward, to, see, ifhis, path, were, clear, a, deep, silence, reigned, around, when, ‘, Dismount, andgive, up, your270, money, ’, resounded, like, thunder, in, his, ears, echoing, awayamong, the, silent, aisles, of, the, mountain, forest, Two, men, were, before, himhis, whip, was, wrenched, from, his, hands, he, was, dragged, to, the, ground, therobbers, mounted, his, steed, and, rode, away, ‘, Well, there, I, was, in, a, prettyfix, anyhow, ’, he, said, ‘, sitting, upon, a, mound, of, snow, all, alone, in, awild, wood, at, midnight, my, two, hundred, dollars, and, my, horse, all, gone, Imight, have, said, with, Shakspeare, ’s, queen, ‘, Here, I, in, sorrow, sit, ’, etcbut, I, was, not, in, a, poetical, mood, anyhow, Besides, I, could, blame, no, onebut, myself, for, I, ought, to, have, kept, my, eye, skinned, and, not, have, beenso, blind, as, not, to, see, the, danger, of, travelling, in, wild, parts, with, somuch, gold, Still, if, the, parts, were, wild, we, had, never, heard, of, anyrobbery, committed, here, and, did, not, expect, it, ’, ‘, Did, you, ever, discoverthe, robbers, ’, we, asked, ‘, Oh, yes, I, went, back, to, the, village, and, everyone, turned, out, to, help, me, There, was, snow, on, the, ground, and, we, were, thusable, to, track, them, I, was, forced, to, go, all, the, way, to, Buffalo, howeverere, one, was, caught, by, the, police, He, had, lived, like, a, prince, all, alongthe, road, and, spent, his, share, of, the, money, ’, ‘, What, became, of, the, otherman, ’, ‘, Why, ma’am, as, I, was, one, day, walking, through, Pratt, street, inBaltimore, some, months, after, whom, should, I, meet, but, my, man, dressed, inthe, newest, style, parading, along, as, proud, as, a, prairie, cock, with, agrand, lady, upon, each, arm, I, knew, him, as, I, had, remarked, him, at, thetavern, and, by, the, bright, moonlight, He, also, remembered, me, and, when, hesaw, my, eye, so, eagerly, fixed, upon, him, without, saying, good, bye, to, theladies, or, even, waiting, upon, them, home, he, scattered, at, once, down, the271street, and, I, after, him, If, you, had, seen, the, ladies, stare, Away, he, wentup, street, down, street, along, the, wharves, in, the, vessels, out, again, Atlast, thinking, he, had, dodged, me, he, sprang, into, an, empty, hogshead, But, Iwasn’t, to, be, did, that, way, anyhow, so, I, flung, a, board, over, the, top, andstanding, on, it, clapped, my, arms, and, crowed, in, such, a, tone, of, triumphthat, all, the, cocks, in, the, neighboring, yards, crowed, in, concert, In, shortmy, man, was, treed, and, imprisoned, but, my, money, was, gone, ’, July, 25th, —, At, daybreak, I, lifted, the, curtain, and, by, the, uncertainlight, of, dawn, beheld, at, my, side, a, wide, river, whose, opposite, shoreswere, green, and, hilly, ‘, Are, we, over, the, mountains, already, What, river, canthis, be, ’, I, asked, With, a, smile, one, of, the, party, informed, me, we, were, onthe, summit, of, a, high, mountain, and, the, deep, valley, filled, with, mistwith, the, opposite, summits, for, a, shore, made, my, river, A, bright, sun, soondispersed, the, mist, and, we, were, never, tired, of, the, variety, of, views, webeheld, upon, every, hand, That, the, mountains, are, not, very, high, adds, to, thebeauty, of, the, scene, their, heads, are, not, lost, in, the, clouds, and, wefrequently, see, the, whole, mass, at, once, While, descending, one, Alleghany, webeheld, another, before, us, like, a, high, green, wall, reaching, to, theheavens, while, a, line, across, the, summit, showed, the, road, we, were, totravel, so, high, and, precipitous, it, seemed, that, we, wondered, how, we, evershould, reach, the, road, Descending, again, this, ridge, we, gazed, out, over, agreat, extent, of, country, or, down, into, deep, valleys, brightened, bywinding, streams, while, trees, and, flowers, and, vines, of, every, tint, andform, adorned272, the, path, The, laurels, were, out, of, bloom, but, their, deepgreen, glossy, leaves, shone, out, continually, from, the, foliage, The, chesnutwas, also, frequent, these, two, giving, names, to, the, two, ridges, we, hadpassed, Laurel, and, Chesnut, ridges, We, also, remarked, the, pretty, stripedmaple, whose, green, bark, is, striped, with, black, This, is, sometimes, calledmoose, wood, as, the, moosedeer, always, seeks, with, avidity, its, tenderleaves, and, bark, The, box, elder, also, occurs, upon, these, slopes, with, theholly, and, varieties, of, the, magnolia, the, turpelo, gum, tree, besidesnoble, forests, of, many, other, trees, The, road, although, leading, overmountain, ridges, and, passes, is, not, a, lonely, one, as, stages, loaded, withpassengers, were, continual, passing, and, huge, Pennsylvanian, waggons, withthe, large, Normandy, horses, high, collar, and, jingling, a, bell, to, givenotice, of, their, approach, The, women, of, the, country, we, often, met, uponhorseback, sitting, upon, their, gaily, embroidered, saddles, The, fine, broadsmooth, National, road, over, which, we, were, passing, enabled, the, drivers, tokeep, their, horses, upon, a, very, quick, trot, I, am, fond, of, rapid, drivingbut, sometimes, it, made, me, rather, nervous, to, dash, at, the, rate, of, eightmiles, an, hour, within, two, feet, of, a, precipice, down, which, we, looked, uponthe, tops, of, trees, a, thousand, feet, below, There, is, however, very, littledanger, as, where, the, descent, is, steep, the, driver, can, in, a, moment, byputting, his, foot, upon, a, spring, at, his, side, cramp, the, wheel, and, checkour, speed, After, ascending, a, high, mountain, we, found, a, tavern, whosesign, bore, the, hospitable, words, ‘, Welcome, from, the, west, ’, We, were, muchpleased, with, this, kind, reception, until, upon, looking, back, perceivedupon, the, other, side, of, the273, sign, ‘, welcome, from, the, east, ’, I, wish, thegood, lady, who, erected, a, statue, to, Clay, would, place, a, monument, upon, theAlleghanies, to, commemorate, honest, Daniel, Boon, who, claims, to, be, thefirst, who, discovered, the, fair, western, plains, Sir, Alexander, Spotswood, agovernor, of, Virginia, penetrated, part, of, the, way, through, the, mountainsThere, was, no, National, road, then, and, the, hills, were, almost, impassableTo, stimulate, discovery, he, instituted, the, order, of, the, goldenhorseshoe, for, those, who, could, pass, the, Blue, Ridge, He, was, anxious, tocounteract, the, influence, of, the, French, upon, the, Mississippi, Thereshould, also, be, a, statue, to, good, old, Father, Marquette, upon, the, shore, ofLake, Michigan, as, before, him, no, white, man, had, penetrated, farther, inthe, wilderness, He, persevered, and, discovered, the, Mississippi, We, passedseveral, towns, as, Smythfield, Petersburg, Frostburg, Cumberland, cThis, last, town, is, in, Maryland, upon, a, branch, of, the, Potomac, one, hundredand, forty, miles, from, Baltimore, The, scenery, around, it, is, beautiful, Itlies, in, a, valley, through, which, glistens, the, Potomac, river, surroundedby, mountains, We, reached, it, this, morning, after, descending, a, slope, whichseemed, to, rise, one, mass, of, rocks, above, us, The, town, has, several, largehotels, a, college, courthouse, and, many, shops, We, stopped, here, tochange, horses, Here, commences, the, transition, formations, the, Appalachianrange, dividing, the, transition, from, the, secondary, formations, of, thewestern, valley, So, clear, and, distinct, is, this, division, that, thecelebrated, geologist, Dr, Aikin, fixed, upon, the, ground, betweenCumberland, and, Hancock, forty, miles, distant, as, the, spot, where, theAppalachian, chain, emerged, from, beneath, upheaved274, by, igneous, action, Themountain, which, we, descended, to, Cumberland, is, called, the, Alleghany, bypreeminence, it, being, the, highest, elevation, and, is, the, ridge, whichdivides, the, waters, which, flow, into, the, Ohio, from, those, which, reach, theAtlantic, The, rocks, which, we, had, observed, upon, our, road, were, the, usuallimestone, marl, and, conglomerates, of, the, west, mixed, with, muchbituminous, coal, while, now, we, remarked, with, them, grey, wacke, andtransition, slates, The, Baltimore, and, Ohio, railroad, will, pass, throughCumberland, and, the, Chesapeake, and, Ohio, canal, Here, also, the, Nationalcommences, and, we, there, left, it, but, found, a, very, good, one, whichcontinued, with, some, failures, during, the, day, We, dined, at, Pine, Grove, asmall, village, Near, the, hotel, is, a, sulphur, spring, which, we, were, obligedto, taste, to, gratify, the, landlord, and, which, was, as, nauseous, as, onecould, desire, This, afternoon, we, passed, some, very, pretty, mountainscenery, none, so, high, as, those, we, had, left, behind, for, we, were, only, uponthe, steps, which, lead, down, from, the, ridge, to, the, plains, below, FromSidling, Hill, we, looked, down, into, a, large, valley, surrounded, by, a, circleof, hills, through, which, a, river, winding, its, way, formed, several, islandsIn, the, centre, was, a, high, rounded, knoll, covered, with, fields, of, ripenedgrain, its, bright, yellow, contrasting, well, with, the, dark, woods, whichsurround, it, They, have, a, curious, way, here, of, laying, the, grain, when, cutin, squares, or, circles, which, looks, very, pretty, at, a, distance, We, tooktea, at, Hancock, a, town, upon, the, banks, of, the, Potomac, The, Chesapeake, andOhio, canal, is, finished, as, far, as, this, place, We, were, but, little, overhalf, way, to, Baltimore, here, having, come, we, were, told, one, hundred, andsixty275, miles, from, Wheeling, Another, night, was, passed, in, the, stage, onlyvaried, by, occasional, stoppages, to, change, horses, About, daybreak, westopped, at, Hagarstown, a, very, large, thriving, place, containingchurches, academies, and, many, handsome, private, dwellings, The, hotelwhich, we, entered, while, the, horses, were, changed, was, large, and, seemedvery, commodious, After, leaving, it, we, found, the, valley, in, which, itstands, was, very, highly, cultivated, It, is, underlaid, with, a, dark, bluelimestone, the, soil, is, very, rich, and, the, wheat, which, it, produces, issent, to, Baltimore, and, highly, esteemed, We, saw, some, of, this, limestonewhich, occasionally, cropped, out, veins, of, calcareous, spar, crossed, theblue, in, some, instances, Quartz, pebbles, and, large, nodules, were, spreadover, the, country, for, miles, between, this, town, and, Frederic, as, if, astorm, of, enormous, hail, had, spent, its, fury, over, the, land, Rounded, piecesas, large, as, a, man, ’s, fist, and, white, as, milk, lay, against, the, fences, orwere, piled, up, by, the, husbandman, The,

At, eleven, o’clock, we, reached, Frederick, city, where, webreakfasted, This, is, a, very, pretty, city, having, an, air, of, antiquity, aswe, now, had, arrived, in, an, old, settled, country, and, the, newly, paintedtowns, were, giving, place, to, what, are, called, old, although, not, what, anEuropean, would, deem, aged, I, was, almost, too, sleepy, to, see, much, of, it, butas, we, rattled, over, paved, streets, and, looked, upon, rows, of, houses, weseemed, quite, at, home, again276, We, bade, adieu, to, the, stagecoach, and, after, a, good, breakfast, enteredthe, railroad, car, and, were, whirled, along, with, a, rapidity, which, wasfrightful, after, our, stagecoach, pace, The, cars, were, handsomelyfinished, having, an, apartment, appropriated, to, the, ladies, wherereclining, upon, the, blue, satin, sofas, we, relieved, our, cramped, limbs, Thecountry, between, Frederick, and, Baltimore, is, very, pretty, I, think, it, isabout, sixty, miles, from, the, one, place, to, the,

river, flows, between, high, banks, of, granite, Fifteenmiles, from, Baltimore, are, the, celebrated, Ellicots, mills, built, of, thegranite, of, the, cliffs, upon, which, they, stand, where, is, ground, theexcellent, Baltimore, flour, raised, from, the, fertile, country, aroundFrederick, and, Hagarstown, Some, of, the, deep, cuts, of, the, railroad, seem, tobe, through, a, mass, of, debris,

fine, viaduct, which, leads, toWashington, we, beheld, Baltimore, an, enormous, mass, of, brick, and, stonelying, upon, the, shore, of, Petapsco, bay, Our, western, friends, were, delightedand, surprised, at, the, sight, of, so, large, a, city, while, driving, through, thestreet, We, arrived, at, Barnham, ’s, large, and, elegant, hotel, just, as, theywere, eating, dinner, We, had, infringed, upon, our, Sabbath277, thus, far, withoutintending, it, as, we, were, told, we, should, arrive, in, Baltimore, in, time, formorning, services, In, the, afternoon, and, evening, however, there,

Baltimore, until, halfpast, nine, wewere, enabled, to, see, much, of, it, Its, monuments, to, Washington, and, to, theheroes, of, the, last, war, are, handsome, and, the, fountain, with, its, coolcanopy, of, shadowy, elms, pretty, its, churches, and, public, buildings, verygood, but, as, you, are, so, well, acquainted, with, it, I, will, not, trouble, youwith, any, details, We, entered, the, railroad, car, at, halfpast, nine, andreached, New, York, at, eleven, that, night, a, distance, of, two, hundred, milesfor, which, we, paid, eight, dollars, each, Several, long, bridges, carried, usover, Bush, creek, Gunpowder, river, and, the, noble, Susquehanna, Our, westernfriends, who, had, been, boasting, of, their, great, rivers, seemed, surprisedat, the, little, use, we, made, of, them, in, travelling, ‘, It, seems, ’, said, ourfair, Missouri, lady, ‘, rivers, here, are, of, no, consequence, —, indeed, are, inthe, way, as, you, make, bridges, and, drive, over, them, ’, At, one,
